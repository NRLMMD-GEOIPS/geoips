# NOTE - each of these sections MUST be referenced in the index.rst template,
# located at source/_templates/index.template.rst. Each optional section is
# created during build_docs.py
#    get_section_replace_string call within the
#    update_content_for_section call, within
#    generate_top_level_index_file call (which is where index.template.rst is referenced), within
#    stage_docs_files_for_building (which is where this docs-sections.yaml file is referenced)
# So - if you have additional optional sections to include, you must
# add them both here, and within the index.template.rst.

 # NOTE getting-started actually is required, because there is a hard coded link to it
 # in index.template.rst, but if we move it to the required section now we will need
 # to add getting-started/index.rst to all repos in order for build_docs to complete.
 # So going to leave it here for now even though it results in a broken link in the
 # documentation when it is not included, until we are ready to update every plugin
 # repo (we will wanted to be entirely sure we have the desired required
 # documentation layout before updating all plugin repos).

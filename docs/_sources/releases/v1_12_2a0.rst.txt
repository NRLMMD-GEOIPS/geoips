Testing Updates
===============

Move PyTest Validation from plugin_registry.py to Unit tests
------------------------------------------------------------
*From GEOIPS#426: 2024-02-02, GeoIPS won't run pip install . w/out [test] target*

GeoIPS currently fails to run if installed by simply calling ``pip install .``. It must,
instead, be installed with pip install .[test]. This is because pytest is used in
geoips/plugin_registry.py but is not included in the base GeoIPS installation
requirements.

To remediate this, we've since moved the pytest validation functionality off of the
PluginRegistry class itself, and moved it into unit tests at
``tests/unit_tests/plugin_registries/test_plugin_registries.py``, under class
PluginRegistryValidator. This removes the need for PyTest to be a GeoIPS dependency,
and is now a Unit Test dependency. If users want to validate their plugin registry, they
will have to manually install pytest to validate from now on.

Unit-Test validation of the plugin registry is performed to ensure it's in the correct
state. This was initially automatically done when it was created, but since it invoked
pytest and that's only a required dependency in the ``test`` extra, we have decided
to move this to a unit-test module so that end-users don't need to install pytest.
All in all, the user doesn't really need to validate their own registry. It
should not be created if an error occurs (eg. duplicate plugin names under the same
interface, poorly formatted plugin, etc.), however as developers we wanted the ability
to unit test the PluginRegistry to make sure everything was being done as expected.

Enhancements
============

Add function to list all available interfaces for each interface 'family'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#397: 2023-11-02, Add function to geoips.interfaces to list all interfaces of each type*

Added a function which lists all interfaces found for each interface family. Rather than
referring to a hard-coded list of interfaces that currently exist, we make assumptions
on the directory structure of the geoips package and list the corresponding interface
modules via the members of 'geoips.interfaces'.

::

    modified: geoips/interfaces/__init__.py

Documentation Scaffold for Coding Standards
-------------------------------------------
This update introduces a scaffold for the documentation of coding standards
for the project, aiming to ultimately enhance code consistency and quality. It
outlines the anticipated content and structure for these standards, providing
a clear framework for future contributions. The new documentation file is
located in the build/dev directory so that it is exempt from sphinx builds.


Added Log with Emphasis function
--------------------------------

Scattered throughout GeoIPS (and other packages too), are many Log statements that use
'***********************...' to emphasize the content in between them. While this is
easy to see in the Log output, it's extremely cluttered in the actual code. For this
reason, I've added a 'log_with_emphasis' function to handle this. All you need to do now
is 'log_with_emphasis(LOG.<log_type>, message)', and it will do the rest for you.

Introduced documentation for coding standards for module imports.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout GeoIPS, we have inconsistent module imports. These new standards (added to
our documentation) will help us be more intentional in how we import modules going
forward.

::
    modified: docs/dev/coding_standards.rst

Introduced documentation for PEP8 standards.
--------------------------------------------

Throughout GeoIPS, we have inconsistent coding standards. PEP8 (added to
our documentation) is an external standard we already use, and so we want
that to be explicit in our documentation.

::
    modified: docs/dev/coding_standards.rst

Added documentation for current linters and configuration.
----------------------------------------------------------

GeoIPS makes use of a number of different linters and linter plugins. This
documentation lists and briefly describes each linter and gives configuration
information.

::
    modified: docs/dev/coding_standards.rst

Introduced documentation for coding standards on how/when to bring code to standard
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout GeoIPS, we have inconsistent coding practices. These new standards (added to
our documentation) will help us be more intentional in how we bring old code
up to date going forward.

    modified: docs/dev/coding_standards.rst

Bug Fixes
=========

Fix polar data not showing up in imagery
----------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#431: 2024-02-06, Look into polar projections in pyresample wrappers*

Currently products with polar projection sectors do not plot. Initial investigations
indicate pre-sectoring the data does not work well with data over the poles. It seems
passing ``--no-presectoring`` option at the command line helps - but there may be
additional issues with polar projections.

It was found that we are misinterpreting how pyresample's AreaDefinition attribute
``area_extent_ll`` is formulated. For polar sectors, when looking at such attribute,
it has been found that ``min_lat`` and ``max_lat`` values are extremely close to each
other, if not equal. While internally the AreaDefinition includes data from min_lat to
max_lat over the poles, we are interpretting those values as a line or a very small
swath, which usually misses some, if not all of the data you're attempting to plot.

We've added additional checks within ``geoips/xarray_utils/data.py`` --
``sector_xarray_spatial``, to modify the area_extent_ll to reflect the actual bounds
we want to include in our sectored data. While it may capture a greater area than
necessary, we fix the problem of missing data for polar imagery.

algorithm_interpolator_colormapper incorrectly interpolates data
----------------------------------------------------------------

This was found during the development for the GLM reader. Apparently, at line 1033 of
single_source.py procflow, when trying to interpolate data under the
algorithm_interpolator_colormapper family, we call 'interp_plugin' with the same
input and output xarray. This makes no sense, and needs to be fixed. It wasn't changing
the data in this format. To fix it, we leave input_xarray as 'alg_xarray', and set
output_xarray to 'None'. This is handled properly in the interpolator, and will modify
coordinate arrays to fit the shape of the interpolated data. I've checked config_based,
and this doesn't occur for that procflow.

    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/procflows/single_source.py

Make add_log_level a callable class, ensure log.interactive works consistently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Move addition of interactive log level into __init__*
*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors*

Remove call to ``add_log_level()`` from ``setup_logging()`` and into ``geoips/__init__.py``.
This makes ``log.interactive()`` available to all components of GeoIPS, regardless of how
they are accessed. Previously, if a plugin was used without the rest of GeoIPS (e.g. a
reader) it would raise an ``AttributeError`` if it called ``log.interactive()``.

This additionally makes add_log_level into a callable class called LogLevelAdder which must
be instantiated prior to use. This fixes a problem where AttributeErrors were raised from
time to time. The way that they occurred required them to be ignored, even when they were
useful. Now, only useful AttributeErrors should be raised.

Update Dockerfile to install rasterio properly
----------------------------------------------

..
    *From GEOIPS#NN: 2024-03-XX, TODO*

Previously building the provided Dockerfile did not build a working image.
It failed on the last step (installation of geoips) and hangs on installing rasterio.
This fix updates the Dockerfile to install rasterio dependancies (``gdal-bin`` and
``libgdal-dev``) and additionally installs software-properties-common for access to
add-apt-repository to aid in gdal installation.

::
    modified: Dockerfile

Remove inconsistent unit test test_log_interactive_non_geoips
-------------------------------------------------------------

The recently added ``test_log_interactive_non_geoips`` unit test is inconsistent. It
sometimes successfully raises an ``AttributeError`` but not always. This is due to
GeoIPS polluting the ``logging`` class when adding new logging levels. The polluted
``logging`` class does not appear to be a problem, though, since it adds functionality
without impacting existing functionality. It appears safe to allow this pollution.

::

    modified: tests/unit_tests/commandline/log_setup.py

Remove unnessesary checks for and mentions of imagemagick
---------------------------------------------------------
..
  *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#: YYYY-MM-DD, Removed unnecessary requirement for imagemagick*

In v1.11.3a0 imagemagick functionality was replaced with other libraries. As such,
imagemagick was no longder a dependancy. However, the installation docs, Dockerfile,
and setup scripts were not updated to reflect this change at the time. This fixes a
bug during installation where the user is forced to install imagemagick to pass tests
despite it no longer being used. It also updates the documentation accordingly.

Add make to expert installation dependencies
--------------------------------------------
..
  *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#454: 2024-03-15, Add make to expert installation dependencies*


`pypublicdecompwt` is a dependency of geoips. `make` is a dependency of `pypublicdecompwt`.
To install `pypublicdecompwt` you need `make`, but it's not listed as a dependency on
the expert installation instructions. It was added.

Fix bad filename wrapping with log_with_emphasis
------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#468*

Fixes poor wrapping for long filenames when logged with emphasis. Now does not auto-wrap
long filenames and prints as is. Additionally, any word logged over 74 chars will not be
broken.

Update log_with_emphasis to deal with empty strings
---------------------------------------------------

Previously, when calling log_with_emphasis(log, "test", "") an error is thrown.
This is a problem if you're logging out a message that ends with "" for any reason,
and log_with_emphasis has now been updated to gracefully deal with this case.

Fixed broken unit test in test_log_setup.py
-------------------------------------------

*Stems from GEOIPS#464, 2024-04-15: Finish log with emphasis function*

*Finish log with emphasis PR (#464)* introduced a couple of bugs that weren't caught by
GeoIPS devs. This PR fixes those bugs and ensues that both the unit tests and accociated
scripts pass without failure. This fix changes a bug in test_log_setup.py where
``generate_random_messages(add_long_word=True)`` would return a ``map`` object rather
than an iterable list of strings. ``map`` objects have no length attribute and caused
failures within ``geoips/commandline/log_setup:log_with_emphasis``. We also added a type
cast in ``log_with_emphasis`` that prevents non-string objects from raising an error due
to a ``len(object)`` call, where the object had no attribute length. Developers should
think about what is sent to ``log_with_emphasis`` if they want to print something that
is not a string.

Refactor
========

Refactor optional imports in readers to use context manager function
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#338: 2023-07-19, Clean up optional dependencies*

Some GeoIPS readers include optional dependency statements that are required to read
certain file formats. While keeping these imports as optional is ok, we should clean up
the manner in which this is implemented. To do so, we've created a separate
``geoips.utils.context_managers.py`` script which can handle optional imports scattered
throughout the GeoIPS codebase. This is essentially replacing our old manner of optional
dependencies with a new method that keeps things clean.

Modify create_plugin_registries to use argparse
-----------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#416: 2023-12-21,
Replace create_plugin_registries 'sys.argv' calls with 'argparse' library'*

Currently create_plugin_registries.py uses sys.argv calls to generate its arguments
rather than argparse. This doesn't follow GeoIPS conventions nor that of the CLI that
will soon be updated. We should replace these calls with argparse architecture, so that
this code follows current conventions, as does other GeoIPS code.

::

    modified: geoips/geoips/create_plugin_registries.py

Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#429: 2024-02-02, Plugin Registries Should Be Readable*

Currently, the JSON output of the plugin registries is a hodge-podge full of text. We
should refactor the way in which these plugin registries are outputted, so that they are
in a human readable, interpretable format. To do so, we need to add the argument
``indent=4`` to the ``json.dump`` call in ``write_plugin_registries``.

Documentation
=============

Added Documentation for create_plugin_registries and PluginRegistry Class
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the addition of create_plugin_registries and the new PluginRegistry Class, we have
a need to add documentation describing what these do, how they are used, and the
benefits that come from adding them to the main GeoIPS code. This branch does exactly
that, and adds a section under 'UserGuide' describing what these pieces of code actually
do. To support automatically adding usage information to the documentation
we've also added a dependency on sphinxcontrib-autoprogram and enabled it in
the sphinx configuration file.

Enhancements
============

Create "output_checkers" interface
----------------------------------

Refactor "compare_outputs.py" python module into an "output_checkers" interface,
and split into multiple plugins for different product types.

Added unit tests for readers
----------------------------

Created file to unit test readers on test data sets. Uses
existing test data found in $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR.

This unit test expects "get_test_files" and "get_test_parameters"
methods on any readers that support unit testing, and the
"reader_test.py" unit testing infrastructure uses those
methods to ensure all required metadata and variables
are included in the reader, based on the geoips xarray
standards.

A future update will additionally check min, max, and
mean value of an expected variable from each reader's
test dataset, and potentially additional relevant information for
each reader.  For now this unit test only tests the
required metadata and variables.

Added required methods to 7 current readers.

Create "output_checker_kwargs" commandline argument
-----------------------------------------------------

With the addition of output_checkers, we decided we would also like to have flexibility
with our pixel comparisons, as well as any other types of comparisons. Therefore, we
need to add a commandline argument called "output_checker_kwargs" to handle this.
Specifically for images, we'd like to have the ability to adjust the "image_threshold"
(% difference between pixels), for different user needs. This update adds three
threshold values ["lenient" (10%), "medium" (5%), "strict" (0%)].

Bug Fixes
=========

Include full path to remss_reader import
----------------------------------------

pytest errored due to ambiguous relative import, so update to use full path
to geoips.plugins.modules.readers.utils.remss_reader utility within the
amsr2_remss_winds_netcdf and smap_remss_winds_netcdf readers.

::

  modified: geoips/plugins/modules/readers/amsr2_remss_winds_netcdf.py
  modified: geoips/plugins/modules/readers/smap_remss_winds_netcdf.py

Do not fail if setup_logging is called twice
--------------------------------------------

Instead of raising AttributeError and catastrophically failing if setup_logging
is called twice, just catch the error and continue on when INTERACTIVE is
attempted to be added a second time.  This allows multiple modules to setup
logging without catastrophic failure.

::

    geoips/commandline/log_setup.py


Fix Upside Down Geotiff Error
-----------------------------

Geotiffs created by GeoIPS are upside down when imported into other applications, such
as Google Earth. We need to fix this so users aren't confused

Fixed from scipy.ndimage.interpolation import zoom deprecation warning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The scipy.ndimage.interpolation library was deprecated as of scipy v1.2 (Dec 2018),
and was causing warnings when importing the zoom libary for the ahi_hsd reader and
the abi_netcdf reader.

The following files have been modified to remove those deprecation warnings.

    * modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/readers/abi_netcdf.py
    * modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/readers/ahi_hsd.py

Raise error when two plugins have the same name
-----------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#382: 2023-10-23*

Currently in GeoIPS, if two plugins of the same interface have the same name, one is
just overwritten. This would occur in the order in which GeoIPS defines its entry
points. This is a bug, and needs to be fixed. To do so, we check all
registered_plugins.yaml found in each package, loop through them, and compare them
against every other plugin registry. If duplicates are found, an error is raised, and
the registries are removed until one of the duplicates is renamed.

Documentation Updates
=====================

Add Links Throughout GeoIPS Documentation
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#322: 2023-09-14, Add Links Throught GeoIPS Sphinx Documentation*

Links in much of the GeoIPS documentation were relative paths to RST files within
the docs/source directory.  This does not work within sphinx-built html documentation.
All relative path links updated to valid sphinx ref links.

Refactoring Updates
===================

Convert base.py: plugin_module_to_obj to class-based method
-----------------------------------------------------------

Currently, base.py: plugin_module_to_obj is a standalone function in interfaces/base.py,
which causes unneccesary confusion and should be converted to a class-based function
under BaseModuleInterface. This follows the convention of plugin_yaml_to_obj under
BaseYamlInterface, which is a much better implementation.

::

    modified: geoips/interfaces/base.py

Rename Geostationary Sectors
----------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#304: 2023-08-27, Rename Geostationary Sectors*

Currently, GeoIPS has sectors that need to be renamed, so they are more informative.
This includes goes16, goes17, and himawari8. We also should add additional Geostationary
sectors, such as meteosat-europe, meteosat-africa, and meteosat-indian-ocean. This will
require changes to the output products as well.

Create PluginRegistry Class
---------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#389: 2023-10-26, Make better use of the plugin registry*

Now that we have a plugin registry, we should make better use of it. Currently,
create_plugin_registries registered_plugins outputs are only made use by YAML
plugins. This is inefficient, and should be converted into a class that is used by
every type of interface and plugin. This would also resolve load_all_yaml_plugins
(geoips/geoips_utils.py) being called for each interface, as we instantiate the plugin
registry at the top most level of BaseInterface. This PR will improve the speed of
GeoIPS, and allow for unit testing for the registry itself.

This PR updated from the initial registered_plugins.yaml implementation to the faster
registered_plugins.json.

Unit tests were also added to test to the plugin registry within this PR.

Also bug fix in interface name for tc_sector_file_parser.py

Also updated path to pytest in full_test.sh (will eventually move to check_code.sh)

Testing Updates
===============

Added Unit Tests for Image Output Checker
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#374: 2023-10-16, Create Unit Test Suite for Output Checker Interface*

Currently, GeoIPS has no unit tests for the output_checkers interface and largely any
GeoIPS interface available. This update adds pytest-based unit tests for GeoIPS image
output_checkers. There will be more unit tests for the remaining output checkers in a
future update.

::

    added: geoips/test/unit_tests/plugins/module/output_checkers/test_output_checkers.py

Attached Unit Tests to Output Checker Plugins
---------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#378: 2023-10-18, Modify Unit Tests to have some functionality attached to the plugin itself*

With the addition of Unit Tests, we've found there is some commonality between function
signatures. While the functions pertaining to the plugin differ, they use the same
inputs. For this reason, we are going to remove these functions from the Unit Test
itself, and attach them to the plugins under the same nomenclature. If the plugin is
missing these functions, raise a pytest.xfail.

    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/output_checkers/text.py

Add text plugins to package registries
--------------------------------------

With the addition of create_plugin_registries, we can access module-based and yaml-based
plugins via those registries. However, that PR did not include text-based plugins, which
are currently found in the GeoIPS package, and others may be added in new packages in
the future. We need to modify this process to include text based plugins.

::

    modified: geoips/geoips/create_plugin_registries.py

Standardized Unit testing
--------------------------------------

Created a pytest configuration file to standardize outputs,diagnostics, and
command line arguments. Modified yaml based unit tests to generate informative
identifiers for pytest output. Included coverage reporting for the pytest output,
but --cov argument must be passed in command line.

Added pytest call to tests/utils/check_code.sh - calls pytest on both the
geoips repo and the current repo that is being tested (since base tests for all
installed plugin packages are called from the geoips repo).

Added recenter_tc check_code.sh call to full_test.sh

Efficiency Improvements
=======================

Changed how run_procflow accesses plugins, by creating a plugin registry
------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#238: 2023-07-06*

Currently, when run_procflow is called, GeoIPS actually has to load in every
existing GeoIPS plugin to find the appropriate plugin. This is very inefficient
and was resulting in 15+ seconds of lag time before run_procflow would actually
run. To fix this, we have created a plugin registry, which is essentially a python
dictionary of all the available plugins. This is now used to select the appropriate
plugin when run_procflow is called.

create_plugin_registries was also added as a console script within pyproject.toml,
so it can be executed as "create_plugin_registries".

::

    added: geoips/geoips/create_plugin_registries.py
    modified: pyproject.toml

create_plugin_registries.py generates a JSON file in the top level directory
of each plugin package called "registered_plugins.json" (we originally implemented
this as a YAML file, but due to efficiency reasons switched it for JSON, which
loads much faster).

The JSON registry file contains an entry for each plugin within the current package,
including the plugin name, interface, and absolute path.
geoips_utils and the base interfaces were updated to use this new plugin registry
rather than the deprecated "plugin cache" (which was created a runtime, every
time geoips was imported).

Note create_plugin_registries is NOT auto-called from within geoips_utils,
if the plugin registry is not found, a PluginRegistryError is raised, prompting
the user to run "create_plugin_registries"

Also note tuple-based interfaces (ie, products, which are stored as
(source_name, product_name)) are expanded out into each full tuple within
the plugin registry, and are accessed directly by their tuple from within
the geoips interfaces.

    modified: geoips/geoips/interfaces/yaml_based/products.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/sector_utils/utils.py

To additionally decrease import time for geoips, move pyresample, geoips.mpl_utils,
and cartopy imports in the base sectors interface module into the respective
methods that use them, as those packages can take several seconds to import.

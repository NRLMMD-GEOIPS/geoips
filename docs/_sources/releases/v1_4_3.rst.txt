Version 1.4.3 (2022-02-17)
**************************

v1.4.3: 2022-02-17, updated test scripts and documentation, jpss-1 to noaa-20

Breaking Interface Changes
==========================

Replace jpss-1 with noaa-20 for VIIRS platform_name
---------------------------------------------------

* VIIRS reader
* VIIRS Night Vis test outputs

Major New Functionality
=======================

Minimum coverage capability
---------------------------

* Add minimum\_coverage option to command line arguments
* Add minimum\_coverage / minimum\_coverages option to YAML output config

    * 'minimum\_coverage' covers all products
    * 'minimum\_coverages' dictionary is on a per-product basis
    * Special "all" key within minimum\_coverages dictionary applies to all products
        (can additionally specify individual products within dictionary).

* Add get\_minimum\_coverage function to dev.output\_config interface module

Expanded example test scripts
-----------------------------

* coverage over the various readers, products, and output formats

    * NEW Visible annotated ABI static
    * NEW IR-BD clean AHI TC
    * 89H-Physical annotated AMSR2 TC
    * 183-3H annotated AMSU-B TC
    * windbarbs clean ASCAT KNMI TC
    * Remove ASCAT UHR annotated windbarbs
    * NEW wind-ambiguities annotated ASCAT UHR TC
    * NEW 89pct clean GMI TC
    * windspeed annotated HY-2B TC
    * NEW Rain clean IMERG TC, no metadata
    * NEW TPW\_CIMSS MIMIC annotated global
    * NEW Infrared unprojected\_image MODIS
    * NEW windbarbs annotated OSCAT KNMI TC
    * NRCS annotated SAR TC
    * WV-Upper unprojected\_image SEVIRI
    * SMAP unsectored text winds (gzipped txt file)
    * SMOS sectored text winds (not gzipped txt file)
    * color89 unprojected\_image SSMIS (multiple granules, RGB)
    * REMOVE VIIRS IR-BD and Visible
    * Night-Vis-IR annotated VIIRS TC (day time! Need to update for night!)

* Add documentation\_imagery.sh script to generate all imagery used in the available\_functionality.rst
    documentation, and copy it into the appropriate directory for use in documentation.
    Return non-zero if any of the commands failed (run\_procflow or copy)
* Add minimum\_coverage and minimum\_coverages options to yaml\_configs/abi\_test.yaml for referencex
    (does not change output)

Expanded available functionality documentation
----------------------------------------------

* Readers - each reader contains a global registered image for reference

    * ABI
    * AHI
    * EWS-G
    * SEVIRI
    * MODIS
    * SMAP (updated with full command)
    * SMOS (updated with full command)
    * HY2 (updted with full command and global registered image)

* Output Formats

    * Unprojected Imagery

Additional test sectors
-----------------------

* bsh062022.dat b-deck file
* bsh252020.dat b-deck file
* bsh112022.dat b-deck file
* bio022021.dat b-deck file
* global.yaml 20km 1000x2000 global area\_def

Updated Night-Vis VIIRS products
--------------------------------

* Added Night-Vis-GeoIPS1 and Night-Vis-IR-GeoIPS1 products for comparison with geoips versions

Improvements
============

* Update imagery\_windbarbs to handle 1D vectors, 2-D vectors only, and 2-D vectors with
    ambiguitie (different numbers of arrays). Ambiguities were NOT getting
    plotted correctly previously.

* Update unprojected\_imagery to allow specifying either or both of x\_size and y\_size,
    and calculating the other if only one was included.

* Rename geoips test scripts to make it clear at a glance what reader, product, and output format they are testing.
* Print copy-and-pasteable command line call at the beginning of each run\_procflow call.
* Installation improvements

    * Separate base requirements from optional requirements.
    * Update setup\_geoips.sh install\_geoips to explicitly include all optional requirements.

Bug fixes
=========

* swap x\_size and y\_size for unprojected imagery
* Update EWS-G to "gvar" source name rather than gvissr
* Added uncompress test script to uncompress the .txt.gz unsectored text wind output.
* Update abi test script names in test\_base\_install.sh (no longer abi.sh and abi\_config.sh)

    * Call test\_base\_install.sh from test\_all.sh
    * Remove abi test calls from test\_all.sh, since they are included in test\_base\_install.sh

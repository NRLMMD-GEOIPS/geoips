Version 1.1.13 (2021-01-29)
***************************

previously known as v1.1.3

(Pending) Remove Code
=====================

* old_tcweb_fnames (Added tc_lon argument to old_tcweb_fnames)
* Remove products/pmw_mint.py

(Pending) Deprecation Warnings
==============================

* find_modules_in_geoips_packages -> find_modules

    * Corrected find module terminology and added support for different module and method names
    * PREVIOUS find_modules_in_geoips_packages(module_name, method_name)

        * from geoips.module_name.method_name import method_name  # Always same method name

    * UPDATED find_modules_in_geoips_packages(subpackage_name, module_name, method_name=None)

        * from geoips.subpackage_name.module_name import method_name

    * Imports in "drivers" will require updating to new terminology. Note this will all go away with Tim entry points

* geoips_modules / $GEOIPS_MODULES_DIR -> geoips_packages and $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR

    * These are convenience variables / directory structures for storing multiple geoips repositories.
    * Updated modules to packages for accurate naming conventions, handle discrepancies in gpaths/config
    * Note this will also all go away with Tim entry points

Breaking Changes
================

* BREAKING CHANGE: standardized platform names

    * sen1 -> sentinel-1, metopa -> metop-a, metopb -> metop-b, metopc -> metop-c, radarsat2 -> radarsat-2
    * NOAA-19 -> noaa-19, NOAA-18 -> noaa-18, amsub -> amsu-b,

* BREAKING CHANGE: Changed wind_speed to vmax in sector_info dictionary for TCs ALSO CHANGED IN PYROCB!!!!!!!

    * Change track_type -> aid_type

* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed area_def -> area_definition xarray attribute

Deprecation Warnings
====================

* get_area_defs_for_xarray -> get_static_area_defs_for_xarray AND get_atcf_area_defs_for_xarray

    * (added get_trackfile_area_defs)

* commandline run_yaml_from_deckfile.py -> convert_trackfile_to_yaml.py

* commandline update_atcf_database.py -> update_tc_tracks_database.py

* sector_utils/atcf_tracks.py -> sector_utils/tc_tracks.py

    * sector_utils/atcf_database.py -> tc_tracks_database.py

* colormaps.py -> colormap_utils.py - moved colormaps into subpackage user_colormaps

* moved set_matplotlib_colors_standard from mpl_utils to colormap_utils

    * -    from geoips.image_utils.mpl_utils import set_matplotlib_colors_standard
    * +    from geoips.image_utils.colormap_utils import set_matplotlib_colors_standard

* products/global_stitched -> products/stitched

* some imports from mpl_utils moved to user_colormaps and/or colormap_utils

    * -from geoips.image_utils.mpl_utils import set_matplotlib_colors_37H
    * +from geoips.image_utils.user_colormaps.pmw import set_matplotlib_colors_37H
    * +from geoips.image_utils.colormap_utils import set_matplotlib_colors_standard
    * +from geoips.image_utils.user_colormaps.winds import set_matplotlib_colors_winds

Refactoring
===========

* Created separate modules for each visir and pmw products within algorithms/visir and algorithms/pmw

    * Previously all separate products were combined within products/visir.py and products/pmw_tb.py

* Standardized geolocation generation for ABI/AHI/SEVIRI

New Readers
===========

* Added amsu-b MIRS reader
* Added MIMIC reader
* Added MODIS hdf4 reader

Performance Upgrades
====================

* For xarray sectoring - pass "check_center" and "drop" to allow checking coverage based on the center of the image,
    and completely dropping rows and columns that are unneeded

New functionality
=================

* Added additional command line arguments:
    * atcf_db, atcf_db_sectorlist to specify TC processing based on the TC database
    * trackfiles, trackfile_parser, and trackfile_sectorlist to specify processing based on the flat sectorfile
* Added support for arbitrary TC trackfile parsing - currently flat sectorfile and G-decks
*  Added xml_to_yaml geoips1 sectorfile conversion utility
*  Added parallax_correction argument to data_manipulations.merge.merge_data
    * Currently does not blend msg-1 with AHI near the equator, later could implement optical flow based corrections
*  Allow building documentation for alternative geoips packages, not only geoips
*  Added ambiguity wind barb plotting
*  Added global stitched imagery capability
*  Added TPW processing
*  Allow optional fields for netcdf output filename
*  Fully support xml -> yaml conversions for geoips1 sectorfiles.
*  Replace '-' with '_' in method and module names for find_modules
*  Added overpass predictor
*  Added static sector database
*  Added database of TC overpasses

Bug Fixes
=========

* Resolved bug with transparency behind titles / borders for cartopy plotting
* Ensure metadata goes in _dev directory if product is in _dev directory
* Use make_dirs for netcdf write (sets permissions) rather than os.makedirs()

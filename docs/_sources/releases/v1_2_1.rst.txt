Version 1.2.1 (2021-10-04)
**************************

v1.2.1: Test repo output updates (remove recentering, updated matplotlib/cartopy), and code refactor/simplification

Breaking Interface Changes
==========================

* remove_duplicates function now takes the explicit filename_format string, and returns the remove_duplicates
    method within the <filename_format> module.
* Separated sar_netcdf reader from sfc_winds_netcdf.py

    * Eventually plan to separate all sfc_winds readers - they should all be independent modules.

Breaking Test Repo Updates
==========================

* Updated cartopy to 0.20.0 and matplotlib to v3.4.3

    * test repo outputs incompatible with matplotlib < 3.4.0 and cartopy < 0.19.0
    * Older versions have figures that are very slightly shifted from later versions
    * Exclusively a qualitative difference, but it *does* cause the test comparisons to fail

* No longer recentering all TC outputs by default

    * General outputs are *not* recentered as of 1.2.1 - test recentering separately from other functionality

Refactor
========

* Moved metoctiff plugin to a separate installable repository
* Moved recenter_tc plugin to a separate installable repository

Major New Functionality
=======================

* Initial center radius coverage checks, for Tropical Cyclone applications
* Initial SAR Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) product implementation

Improvements
============

* Standardized and formalized the README, setup script, and test script format for all plugin repos
* Removed requirement to link test scripts from plugin repos into the main geoips test directory

Bug fixes
=========

* Added "METADATA" key in sfc_winds_netcdf.py return dictinoary

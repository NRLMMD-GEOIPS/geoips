Version 1.4.1 (2022-01-21)
**************************

v1.4.1: 2022-01-21, viirs and smap output config test scripts and documentation

Refactor
========

* Allow passing cbar\_ticks to matplotlib\_linear\_norm module

Major New Functionality
=======================

* Add SMAP unsectored text winds explicit test call and sample output
* Add SMAP test script to test\_all.sh
* Add bwp202021.dat deck file with SMAP test dataset coverage
* Add VIIRS explicit test script and sample outputs

    * bsh192021.dat sector
    * IR-BD and Night-Vis-IR annotated imagery output

* Add himawari8 test sector
* Add VIIRS explicit est call to test\_all.sh

Improvements
============

* Add aerosol reader and fname as arg options
* Add channel number as variable in AHI HSD reader
* Adjust selection of variable for interpolation in single\_source.py if the same variable name is contained in multiple datasets 

    (ie, VIIRS geolocation variables - slightly different for each resolution dataset - caused issues with differing test outputs between single source and config\_based when multiple datasets are present)

    * Use variable from dataset that contains ALL required variables
    * Use variable from first dataset

* config\_based procflow now always sector to the adjusted area\_def to ensure we get all of the data.

    * Also must sector before adjusting the area\_def to ensure we have a consistent center time for determining new area\_def 
      (slightly different center times resulting from different sectoring can cause very slightly different recentering)

Documentation Updates
=====================

* Add VIIRS sensor and Night-Vis-IR product to avaialble functionality documentation
* Add SMAP unsectored text winds sample output to "available\_functionality" documentation

Bug fixes
=========

* Correct typo in config\_based.py (product\_name in pad\_alg\_xarrays, not alg\_xarrays)
* Update viirs\_netcdf.py to sort filenames prior to reading - intermittent failure if filenames are not sorted in advance
* No longer converting min/max value to int before normalizing in matplotlib\_linear\_norm colormap

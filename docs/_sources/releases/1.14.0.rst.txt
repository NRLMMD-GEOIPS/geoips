==============

Move reusable workflows and sync files to geoips_ci
---------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

Create a new repository, geoips_ci, that will manage all GeoIPS Ecosystem
reusable workflows, as well as files to sync to all GeoIPS plugin
repositories.

Simplify brassy-notes and tag-and-release to filter on pr merged immediately
(rather than trying to pass pr merged flag into reusable workflow). These should
never run on a closed but not merged PR.

Github actions

Add standard synced files to geoips repo
----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

These files auto-copied from geoips_ci.

Github actions
==============

Turn off pdf doc build from doc-test
------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

We still need to fix the pdf doc build, but turning it off temporarily until
we determine what the issue is.

::

     modified: .github/workflows/doc-test.yaml

Github actions
==============

Turn off rst release note check from version release branches
-------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

Since version releases often have corrections to RST release notes, do not fail
on RST release note check within version release branches.

::

     modified: .github/workflows/release-note-check.yaml

Github actions
==============

Move 1.14.0 and 1.14.1 rst files into latest/*.yaml and upcoming/*.yaml
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

No longer deleting YAML files or checking in rst files - store
all release notes as YAML in perpetuity, and auto-generate the
rst with brassy every time. This will make rolling back releases
MUCH easier.

Documentation
=============

Make all documentation sections optional
----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

Previously required introduction and user guide - allow building documentation
with only release notes and API.

Documentation
=============

Resolve pdf doc build issues
----------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

PDF doc builds often fail when html succeeds - this MUST be tested regularly
on PR merge, to ensure we keep up with pdf builds as well as html. Much easier to
resolve issues as they crop up rather than much later when we realize it's failing.

Temporarily turn off all pdf builds, and comment out the pdf download from the
documentation index template.

Installation
============

Remove path and python path from setup configs
----------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

This was causing problems with using the wrong python/pip during processing.
Do not explicitly set PATH or PYTHONPATH.

Documentation
=============

Build rst release notes from yaml files every time
--------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

Rather than generating and checking in RST files with
each release, save all the original YAML files and produce
RST every time from within build_docs.sh.

Store the release notes in X.Y.Z directories, producing
X.Y.Z.rst during the build_docs process. Update the index.rst
generating code to support either vX_Y_Z.rst or X.Y.Z.rst
filename format.

This allows simply moving the 'latest' release note directory
to X.Y.Z during the release process, and maintaining a record
of all the original release notes in perpetuity, facilitating
rapid release roll backs or evaluation of previous release notes.

Note we also now ignore an 'upcoming' release note directory,
as that is a temporary location to store the release note for
the upcoming release during the version release process for
the current version ('latest').  At the end of the release
process, the 'upcoming' directory will be moved to 'latest'
to prepare for the next release.

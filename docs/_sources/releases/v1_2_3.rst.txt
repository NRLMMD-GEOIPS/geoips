Version 1.2.3 (2021-11-05)
**************************

v1.2.3: 2021-11-05, text wind outputs, internal dictionary of xarray datasets, unique TC filenames

Breaking Interface Changes
==========================

* Replaced internal lists of xarray datasets with dictionary of xarray datasets

    * xarray_utils/data.py sector_xarrays function now takes and returns dictionaries
    * procflows/single_source.py get_area_defs_from_command_line_args function now takes dictionary

Breaking Test Repo Updates
==========================

* Updated filenames to identify product implementation

    * bg<product_name> (ie, bgVisible) if background imagery was applied

Major New Functionality
=======================

* unsectored_xarray_dict_to_output_format product type

    * Hooks in single_source and config_based procflows to generate product immediately after reading data

* sectored_xarray_dict_to_output_format product type

    * Hooks in single_source and config_based procflows to generate product immediately after sectoring

* Text wind output capability

    * 'unsectored' and 'sectored' products
    * 'text_winds_full_fname' and 'text_winds_tc_fname' filename formats

* SMAP and AMSR2 config-based processing

Improvements
============

Updated test_all.sh script set up to take any script that has a valid exit code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Previously test scripts called from test_all.sh required specific setup
* Updated to generically handle return codes from any scripts - simplifies testing setup

Updated test_all_run.sh sub-script to check log outputs for "success" strings before returning 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* If return is 0, grep the log output for one of a set of "success" strings

    * SETUPSUCCESS
    * FOUNDPRODUCT
    * SUCCESSFUL COMPARISON DIR
    * GOODCOMPARE

* If no success strings are present, return 42.
* protects against test scripts that inadvertently do not exit with the proper error code

Removed old testing construct - replace with explicit test scripts
------------------------------------------------------------------

* config-based testing now handles the exhaustive functionality tests (much faster)

    * SMAP fully implemented
    * AMSR2 fully implemented

* scripts with explicit command line call for minimal single_source and overlay functionality testing

Additional information in tc_fname extra field for different product enhancements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* bg<product_name> (ie, bgVisible) if background imagery was applied
* cr<radius> (ie, cr300) if center radius coverage check was used

Bug fixes
=========

* Update all readers to include 'METADATA' field (now explicitly required)

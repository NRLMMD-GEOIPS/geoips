Version 1.4.7 (2022-05-06)
**************************

v1.4.7: 2022-05-06, multiple coverage check types, ability to plot coverage outline, optional version requirements

Major New Functionality
=======================

Add ability to plot coverage outline
------------------------------------

single_source.py procflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Allow passing optional "output_dict" to output_format modules

imagery_annotated.py output_format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Allow checking for "plot_coverage" option in product params from imagery_annotated output format

center_radius.py coverage check module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add "plot_coverage" function to center_radius coverage check module.
* When "plot_coverage" is added to product params imagery_annotated will call this function to
    include the outline of the coverage check function. Add via:

    * in YAML product spec, or
    * command line "product_params_override", or
    * in YAML output config "product_params_override"
    * imagery_annotated will call this function to include the outline of the coverage check function.

Improvements
============

Update Coverage Checks to Allow filename, full, and image_production based checks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Include fname, full, and image_production covg funcs in metadata_tc outputs
* Use "fname_covg_func" rather than "covg_func" when setting coverage for filename
* Use max of "fname_covg" and "image_production_covg" when testing for minimum coverage

Installation Updates
--------------------

* Moving version requirements for efficiency improvements to extra_requires

    * Rather than forcing satpy>=0.33.1 and pyresample>=1.22.3, include as an extra
        "efficiency_improvements" package in setup.py

    * Then, install efficiency_improvements and test_outputs extras FIRST so those packages and dependencies are
        installed first if desired.

Duplicate File Removal
----------------------

* For tc_fname format, rather than only checking coverage, now have a 3 tiered duplicate file check:

    * If file has < max_coverage, delete
    * If file has > min_dt, delete
    * If another file has already been matched, delete (this is random!)

Output Filenames
----------------

* If output_fname is None, do not add to list or attempt to create metadata filename

    * Allow filename_formats to return None. If invalid, just continue.
    * This allows specifying multiple filename formats, and skipping formats that are invalid.

Real-time processing
--------------------

* config\_based.py

    * Moved product database writes to new write_to_database function

Bug fixes
=========

Real-time processing
--------------------

* config\_based.py

    * Added two new calls to write_to_database function, that stores unsectored and sectored products to database (these were previously missed)

Version 1.2.0 (2021-09-15)
**************************

v1.2.0: Major backwards incompatible update for stable and dev plugin interface implementation

Breaking Interface Changes
==========================

* Removed all deprecated code
* Developed dev interface for accessing modules, moved plugins to geoips/interface_modules

    * algorithms, area_def_generators, coverage_checks, filename_formats, interpolation,
        mtif_params, output_formats, procflows, trackfile_parsers, user_colormaps

* Developed finalized stable interface, moved stable plugins to geoips/interface_modules

    * readers

* Consolidated YAML config files in geoips/yaml_configs

Refactor
========

* Moved geoips package into subdirectory for pip installability

Major New Functionality
=======================

* Exhaustive test scripts with final return value of 0 for successful completion of all functionality
* dev and stable interfaces, allowing entry point based plugins
* Initial geotiff output support
* Initial full disk output support
* Night Visible products
* Gdeck and flat sectorfile trackfile parsers

Improvements
============

* YAML based product specifications (references colormaps, algorithms,
    interpolation routines, coverage checks, etc)

Bug fixes
=========

* Resolved sectoring issue, allowing complete center coverage

    * Previously when sectoring based on min/max lat/lon, any values outside the explicit
        requested values would be masked, causing masked data on non-square datasets when 
        good data was actually available for the entire requested region. Only drop rows outside
        requested range, do not mask data.

Performance Upgrades
====================

* Initial config-based processing implementation, which will allow efficiently processing
    multiple output types in a single run.

Version 1.2.2 (2021-10-25)
**************************

 v1.2.2: 2021-10-25, config-based processing, global stitching, AWS-based test cases, separate sfc_winds readers

Breaking Interface Changes
==========================

* Separated all surface winds readers from sfc_winds_netcdf

    * smos_winds_netcdf
    * smap_remss_winds_netcdf
    * amsr2_remss_winds_netcdf
    * windsat_remss_winds_netcdf
    * scat_knmi_winds_netcdf
    * ascat_uhr_netcdf

Breaking Test Repo Updates
==========================

* Updated default padding amount from 2.5x to 1.5x

    * caused slightly modified output times in titles for some data types (identical data output, slightly modified center time)

        * test_data_ahi_day
        * test_data_amsr2
        * test_data_ascat_bin
        * test_data_smap
        * test_data_viirs

Refactor
========

* Separated all surface winds readers from sfc_winds_netcdf (see breaking interface changes)

Major New Functionality
=======================

* Modular geostationary stitching capability

    * SEVIRI, ABI, and AHI
    * single channel products tested (Infrared-Gray and WV)

Improvements
============

* Single installation script with prompts to step through all installation/testing steps

    * Replaces step-by-step copy-paste in README with single call to full_nrl_installation.sh

* Installation steps now return 1 for failed pulls and updates and fail catastrophically

    * Ensure timely notification of failure to reduce incomplete installations
    * Does not continue with further steps until all steps complete

* Standard installation and testing now includes AWS-based ABI testing

    * Prevents requiring separate test data repo for basic testing -
        everything required is included in the geoips repo
        (comparison outputs, and commands to obtain test datasets).

* Added SatZenith, sensor_scan_angle, and channel number attributes to PMW readers (supports CRTM)

    * SSMI/S
    * AMSU-B
    * AMSR2

Bug fixes
=========

Resolved issue with SMAP only processing one of the 2 daily overpasses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Previously always filtered dynamic area_defs to return a single area_def based on the data center_time

    * Now only return single area_def for data files covering < 3h
    * Now return ALL area_defs for data files covering > 3h
    * Now filter area_defs during processing - after sectoring datafile,
        check if the current area_def is the "closest", if not, skip.

Resolved bug in AMSU-b start and end time
-----------------------------------------

* Previously pulled start/end time from filename - test datafile actually had incorrect time listed!
* Updated to pull directly from the metadata.

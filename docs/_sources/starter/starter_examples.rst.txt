Full Install
============

In order to obtain all test repos and plugin repositories currently
available publicly, you can run the test script
$GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips/tests/test_full_install.sh.
This will download, install, and test all possible data types and products.

Step by Step
============

In the future, we will provide simple step by step examples using Jupyter
Notebooks in order to quickly get up to speed on GeoIPS capabilities and
functionality. Maybe we could link to some Jupyter notebooks here?

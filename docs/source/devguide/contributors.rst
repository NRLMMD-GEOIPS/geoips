Contributors Guide
==================

The GeoIPS Team encourages active participation by the user and developer community,
so we welcome any and all feedback on and updates to the code base.

Each step in this process can be completed by one or more individuals
(we encourage collaboration!), so feel free to submit Issues even if
you have no intention of resolving it yourself. And feel free to
submit a Pull Request even if all tests are not complete - someone
else may have time to finalize for approval even if you are unable.

See `GeoIPS Git Workflow <git_workflow>` for more information on our git/GitHub workflow
and `Developer Environmental Setup <dev_setup>` for instructions for setting up your
developmental environment.

GeoIPS Contributors Guide
=========================

The GeoIPS Team encourages active participation by the user and developer community,
so we welcome any and all feedback on and updates to the code base.

Each step in this process can be completed by one or more individuals
(we encourage collaboration!), so feel free to submit Issues even if
you have no intention of resolving it yourself. And feel free to
submit a Pull Request even if all tests are not complete - someone
else may have time to finalize for approval even if you are unable.


Contributions generally follow the process of:

1. `Submit a GitHub Issue`_ for a bug fix or feature request.
2. `Branch off a given Issue`_ in order to make the required changes
3. `Create a github Pull Request`_ in order for your changes to be reviewed
   prior to being merged to the integration branch
4. Ensure all required tests pass prior to PR approval (more info coming soon)

   * Unit tests
   * Integration tests
   * Code formatting/style tests
   * Documentation formatting/style tests

5. `Merge your changes`_ into the main code base!

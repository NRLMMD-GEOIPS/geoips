Documentation and Style Strategy
===========================================

GeoIPS uses Sphinx with the Napoleon extension for automated documentation generation.

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html

The **geoips/docs** directory contains high level restructured text (rst) format
documentation (including this page), along with a **build_docs.sh** script that
will setup sphinx and build complete documentation from the high level rst
files as well as docstrings contained within the GeoIPS source code.


GeoIPS Syntax and Style Checking
------------------------------------

GeoIPS uses the NumPy docstring format within the code base for simplicity:

https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

bandit, flake8, and black are used to enforce appropriate style, security,
and syntax usage.  flake8-rst and flake8-rst-docstring plugins are used to
enforce numpy docstring formatting.  Sphinx is used to validate the
formatting and syntax within RST files themselves.

Corresponding configuration files for both black and flake8 can be found
in the geoips directory ``.config/``. 

All branches must pass the ``geoips/tests/utils/check_code.sh`` script
prior to any Pull Requests being approved and merged.  Please ensure this
script has a successful 0 return as you develop code within the GeoIPS
Ecosystem to expedite the review and approval process.

VSCode plugins are also available to provide automated syntax checking and
highlighting:

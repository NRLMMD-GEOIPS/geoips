1. Introduction
==================

1.1 Purpose
-----------

The Geolocated Information Processing System (GeoIPS) is a generalized processing system, providing a collection
of **algorithm and product implementations** facilitating **consistent and reliable application** of specific products
across a **variety of sensors and data types**.

GeoIPS acts as a toolbox for internal GeoIPS-based product development
- all modules are expected to have simple inputs and outputs (Python numpy
or dask arrays or xarrays, dictionaries, strings, lists), to enable
portability and simplified interfacing between modules.

Some of the primary benefits / requirements of GeoIPS include:

* Seamless application to proprietary data types and products (no reference to external functionality within the main code base)
* Consistent product application across multiple sensors (both open source and proprietary)
* Flexible workflow to allow efficient real-time processing as well as interactive processing
* Modular interfaces to facilitate product development
* Consistent code base for research and development through operational transitions
* Ability to generate log outputs
* Ability to interface with workflow management tools (cylc)
* Ability to interface with databases (postgres)


1.2 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
---------------------------------------------

This document is primarily intended for system administrators, users, testers and project managers.

Software developers should consider this required reading prior to working through the documentation.


1.3 Product Scope
------------------------

The GeoIPS® "core" package is responsible for data processing from reading and reformatting the data into the
common internal GeoIPS® internal format, through algorithm and product application, to outputting user
configurable data formats (imagery, NetCDF, etc).

Data collection, data transfers, and product dissemination are all site specific implementations for driving
GeoIPS® processing, and fall outside the scope of the GeoIPS® "core" processing system.


1.4 References
---------------------------------------------

Software Requirements Specification Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This Software Requirements Specification Document was developed using the following template:

https://github.com/rick4470/IEEE-SRS-Tempate

Documentation and Style Strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoIPS uses Sphinx with the Napoleon extension for automated documentation generation.

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html

GeoIPS Syntax and Style Checking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoIPS uses the NumPy docstring format within the code base for simplicity:

https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

bandit, flake8, and black are used to enforce appropriate style, security,
and syntax usage.  flake8-rst and flake8-rst-docstring plugins are used to
enforce numpy docstring formatting.


Overall Description
===================


2.1 Product Perspective
-----------------------

The Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) community has an increasingly large number of disparate
data sources available for advanced environmental exploitation – numerical model outputs, rapid
refresh next generation geostationary weather satellites, polar orbiting microwave imagers and
sounders, radar data, direct observations from ships and weather stations, climatology, elevation
and emissivity databases, and many more data types, both static and dynamic.  Additionally, with
the upcoming launch of countless microsats, an efficient and easy-to-use processing system is
imperative for rapid implementation of these new datasets.

The amount of information that can be gained by combining these datasets in unique ways is far
greater than from any single data type.  GeoIPS® will result in a collaborative, easy-to-use
processing system that can support development efforts integrating these disparate data sources
into unique products, and facilitate streamlined operational transitions.  This common platform
will be used across the METOC community – including basic research, real-time implementation,
and operational processing.


With the plethora of weather satellites coming on line, it is imperative to develop a sustainable,
open source, community supported, efficient, modular processing platform to enable future functionality
and facilitate near real-time operational capability for all new sensors and products.

The GeoIPS® project will deliver a much needed capability for efficient environmental data
processing, benefiting METOC users across the community.  The collaborative nature of GeoIPS®
development will lead to increased efficiency and functionality of the final product.


2.2 Product Functions
---------------------

   :width: 800


2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
------------------------------------

There are 4 primary user classes for the GeoIPS® system: researchers, light developers,
expert developers, and operators.

**Researchers** will use the system to generate output products for further analysis,
but will not be implementing major changes to the products or algorithms themselves –
only using the output of GeoIPS® to aid in their research.

**Light developers** will make minor changes to the code base (slight modifications to
basic products, algorithms, sectors, etc), but will not make major changes to the
internals of the GeoIPS® infrastructure.  This allows product customization, without
a deep knowledge of the backend processing architecture.

**Expert developers** will work with the internals of the main GeoIPS-Core code base –
providing new functionality and features that are commonly used by multiple site-specific
implementations.  Expert developers should be intimately familiar with all aspects of
the Software Requirements Specification.

**Operators** will drive GeoIPS® processing via YAML config files, specifying all required
products and sectors.  Operators will implement minimal changes to the GeoIPS® code base,
and will require additional software outside of the GeoIPS® system to drive the real-time
processing (processing workflows, database management systems, data dissemination protocols).


2.4 Operating Environment
-------------------------

GeoIPS® is developed and tested under the GNU/Linux operating system, on 64-bit x86 hardware architecture.

GeoIPS® must be fully functional under RHEL 8.4 with SELinux enabled (including Fortran and C compiled code)


2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
-----------------------------------------

GeoIPS® is a Python 3 based processing system, with support for Fortran and C routines.

Minimum Base Python package requirements include xarray, scipy, pyresample, and pyyaml,
with additional requirements for specific readers and algorithms.

GeoIPS® requires gfortran and gcc compilers – must support gcc version 8, 9, or 10.


2.6 User Documentation
----------------------

The GEOIPS-Core code base, documentation, and tutorial support are available on github.

Test datasets can be obtained from geoips@nrlmry.navy.mil.


2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
--------------------------------

Hardware and software requirements stated in this document are pertinent to the GeoIPS-Core
version of the codebase.  Additional site-specific packages and system implementations could
incur additional resource requirements or software dependencies.

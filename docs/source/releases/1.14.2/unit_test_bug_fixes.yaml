      Add databases interface

      * geoips/interfaces/module_based/databases.py
      * geoips/interfaces/__init__.py

      Add databases interface to alias mapping, cmd instructions

      * geoips/commandline/ancillary_info/alias_mapping.yaml
      * geoips/commandline/ancillary_info/cmd_instructions.yaml

      Update databases interface import in single_source procflow to geoips
      not geoips_db.

      * geoips/interfaces/module_based/databases.py

      Ensure correct families are used from the single source procflow for database
      writes.  Ensure all families are set up correctly in the databases interface,
      with the correct arguments and kwargs so they are called correctly from the
      procflow.

      * geoips/plugins/modules/procflows/single_source.py

bug fix:
  - title: "Bug fixes for CLI"
    description: |
      Ensure we use str(docstring) when constructing package info for tabulate,
      since tabulate will fail if any field is None. Perhaps we want to get
      people to fix the missing docstring, but I expect at this point in the
      code we should not fail catastrophically if a None has made it through.

enhancement:
- description: |
    Add new product yaml for AMSR2 RSS source inputs. This YAML is more or less a carbon
    copy of the amsr2_winds product YAML, but with the sensor name set as amsr2rss

    Also add new test script and comparison outputs for AMSR2 RSS. Add test script call
    to both test_all.sh and integration_tests/full_test.sh

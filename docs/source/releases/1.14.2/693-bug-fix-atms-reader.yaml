bug fix:
- description: |
    Mask data with bad lat/lons. This will not only break downstream interpolation
    but also results in bad start datetimes in the metadata

    Also update how metadata_only impacts the reader behavior. Previously reader would
    read in all data if metadata_only was True, and also did not properly set the
    xarray attributes if metadata_only was False.

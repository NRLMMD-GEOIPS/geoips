Version 1.4.5 (2022-03-18)
**************************

v1.4.5: 2022-03-18, --compare_paths to --compare_path, add --output_file_list_fname, add GEOIPS_COPYRIGHT_ABBREVIATED

Breaking Interface Changes
==========================

Command line argument updates
-----------------------------

* Replaced --compare_paths with --compare_path in command line arguments

    * pass command_line_args to set_comparison_path - if "compare_path" is set in command_line_args,
        use that instead of individual compare_paths within output config
    * Eventually add support for "compare_paths_override" which will allow setting a different
        compare_path for each output_type via command line (dictionary based) - but for now all or nothing

Major New Functionality
=======================

Testing Utilities
-----------------

* Added compare_output_file_list.sh utility, for comparing a list of files with existence on disk (simpler
    output comparison test than actually comparing the contents of each output product).

Command line arguments
----------------------

* Add --output_file_list_fname to command line args, support in config-based and single-source procflows

    * Allows specifying full path to file to store output filenames from current - quickly update
        output file lists for comparison purposes.

* Add support for "filename_format_kwargs" command line option as well as "filename_formats_kwargs" output config.

Sectors
-------

* New TC Templates

    * 2km 512x512
    * 2km 800x800

Product display
---------------

* **base_paths.py**: Add GEOIPS_COPYRIGHT_ABBREVIATED, for use in product titles.

Improvements
============

* **compare_outputs.py**: Add gzip_product functionality

    * Ensure if we gunzip a product during output comparisons, after we run the comparison we re-zip the file.
        Clean up after ourselves, and leave things the way we found them.

* **unprojected_image.py**: Update so default for unprojected_image is NO savefigs_kwargs
    (empty dictionary, which means masked background, rather than default black background)

setup_geoips.sh
---------------

* Remove dependence on git v2.19.1 - cd to directories rather than using git -C
* Explicitly use setup scripts in the following order:

    * setup_<package>.sh install_<package>
    * setup.sh install
    * setup.py (uses pip install)

* If plugin exists in $GEOIPS BASEDIR/installed_geoips_plugins.txt, do not attempt to reinstall

    * Allows initializing installed_geoips_plugins at the beginning of system installation to avoid
        massive reinstallations of common geoips plugin dependencies.

Documentation Updates
=====================

* Formatting changes

    * correct spacing for code blocks and bullets
    * Remove level 4 header from "Available modules" and "Example outputs" in available functionality

* modis from 600 to 200 width
* Updated AMSU-A, AMSU-B, MHS comments for accuracy (MHS == AMSU-B, AMSU-A separate.
    Still using "amsu-b" only in geoips)

Bug fixes
=========

* **bdeck_parser.py**: Remove shell statement - raised error was dropping to shell during testing.

* **memusg.py** utility: Wrap import psutil in try/except so we don't fail if not installed

* **compare_outputs.py**: In test repo auto-generated update scripts, print gunzip before copy,
    and gzip after copy for files that must be gzipped before comparisons.

* **single_source and config_based**: Add newline to the end of "output_file_list", otherwise skipped during shell loop

bug fix:
  - title: "Allow SEVIRI HRIT reader to complete when HRV files present"
    description: |
      SEVIRI HRIT reader does not support the High Res Vis (HRV) files currently,
      so skips over *HRV* files.  When multi-scan-time support was added, files
      were read one at a time, so HRV files were filtered out and the reader
      subsequently failed on the empty list of filenames.  Raise NoValidFilesError 
      on empty list, to allow catching from the reader read_data_to_xarray_dict
      method and skipping over missing files.

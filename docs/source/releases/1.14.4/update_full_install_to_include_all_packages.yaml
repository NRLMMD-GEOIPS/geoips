installation:
  - title: "Update full install to include all packages available on github.com"
    description: |
      Allow passing an argument to full_install.sh that requests installing
      all packages currently available on github.com.  Default full install
      (with no arguments) still includes only actively maintained/tested/vetted
      packages with complete and functional integration tests, but additional
      packages included when "include_reference_repos" is passed to allow
      development on new and planned repositories.

      This also serves to test test_data_github check_system_requirements.sh option,
      since that is currently unused on github.com.

bug fixes:
  - title: "Clone git test data repositories to the correct location"
    description: |
      Previously git test data repositories would be cloned directly in
      $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR, update download_test_data.py to ensure test data
      repos are cloned to $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR/[test_data_repo_name]

bug fix:
- description: |
    Fix bug where the start and end datetime was not properly being tracked for each
    file ingested in the main loop. This was causing issues when attempting to
    concatenate multiple scan times with 2D arrays. Concatenation of multiple files
    for a single scan time is currently only supported with 1D xarray datasets.

    Add new reader for Meteosat Third Generation Flexible Combined Imager (MTG FCI).
    This reader is a wrapper around satpy's FCI reader. MTG FCI data in netCDF format,
    but require a special decompression filter in order to load the data into memory.
    This filter can either be installed using EUMETSAT's fcidecomp plugin package
    (https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/open-source/data-tailor-plugins/fcidecomp/-/tree/2.0.1/)
    or with the hdf5plugin package available on pypi (https://pypi.org/project/hdf5plugin/)
    In order to use this reader, the HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH is a required environment variable
    that points to the directory holding the compiled decompression plugin. The satpy
    documentation notes that 'import hdf5plugin' should be the only requirement to load
    the data using their reader, and while that is the case, it appears that you are
    unable to manipulate the data outside the satpy.scene object and will still encounter
    a "NetCDF: Filter error: undefined filter encountered" error unless HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH
    is a valid environment variable. We are using the pypi hdf5plugin package, and
    set HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH to site-packages/hdf5plugin/plugins.

    Updated the single_channel algorithm to apply a satellite zenith angle cutoff, rather
    than requiring this mask to be applied in a reader. Uses a new function added to the
    data_manipulations.corrections module.

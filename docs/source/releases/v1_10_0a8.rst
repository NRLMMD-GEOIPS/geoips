Enhancements

passed in via command line.

Breaking Changes
================

Replace "description" attribute with "docstring" in BaseInterface
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#193: 2023-04-27, finalize module plugin attributes*

Update the BaseInterface to require module-level docstring (since
numpy-docstring formatting is already enforced, all Python plugins
will already have a module-level docstring defined, so we do not
have to support deprecated formatting).

Set the explicit "docstring" attribute on the plugin, in addition to __doc__.

Remove the "description" attribute from the module-based plugins.

  modified:   geoips/interfaces/base.py

Update all python module-based plugins to use finalized attributes
------------------------------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#193: 2023-04-27, finalize module plugin attributes*

Remove <interface>_type attribute, and added

* interface
* family
* name

Also ensure module-level docstring was nominally correct.

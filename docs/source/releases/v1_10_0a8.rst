Breaking Changes
================

Move sector_loaders.dynamic to sector_generators
------------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#195: 2023-04-26, sector_generators*

These were originally called "area_def_generators", but we moved to
sector_loaders.dynamic originally to generalize for multiple use cases.
Since determined they really are generating area definitions, but
should be generalized to "sector_generators" in case we ever
implement a non-area_def based sector back end.

Note I did not update all of the YAML plugins - they will be updated in
a later PR.

- title: 'Integrate test all into pytest tests'
  description: 'Integration tests for the "full" and "base" suites were integrated into a pytest caller previously. This adapts the test_all.sh file into a similar format to enable testing via pytest instead of shell scripts. Adds "extra" as a pytest mark for the added set of tests.'

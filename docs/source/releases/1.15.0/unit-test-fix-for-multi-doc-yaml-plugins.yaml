bug fix:
- title: 'Commandline Fix for Multi-Document YAML Files'
  description: |
    In the upcoming order-based-procflow PRs, we've introduced a new plugin type called
    'workflows' which can be structured as a multi-document yaml file if wanted.
    workflows.get_plugin(<plugin_name>) works just fine, but when attempting to validate
    a file via 'geoips validate <yaml_fpath>', it would fail if the file was structured
    as a multi-document as it was not coded to handle that. This PR fixes this bug
    by adding logic to handle multi-document files if an extra argument is provided.
    Now a user can validate a workflow plugin in a multi-document yaml file by
    running this modified command 'geoips validate <fpath> <plugin_name>'. Unit tests
    will skip validating these plugins.

    See tests/unit_tests/commandline/test_geoips_validate.py for more information.

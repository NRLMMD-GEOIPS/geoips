enhancement:
- title: 'FCI Reader GeoColor Update'
  description: |
    The fci_netcdf reader originally could not read in raw radiances from incoming data
    files. It only could read reflectances and/or brightness temperatures. This update
    refactors the fci_netcdf reader so that it can read raw radiance values as well.

    This update is useful for the FCI GeoColor product, which needs radiances and
    brightness temperatures to accurately produce a GeoColor outputs. This might be of
    use to other algorithms / products as well.

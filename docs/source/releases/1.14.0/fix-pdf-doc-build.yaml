- title: 'Resolve pdf doc build issues'
  description: |
    *From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

    PDF doc builds often fail when html succeeds - this MUST be tested regularly
    on PR merge, to ensure we keep up with pdf builds as well as html. Much easier to
    resolve issues as they crop up rather than much later when we realize it's failing.

    Temporarily turn off all pdf builds, and comment out the pdf download from the
    documentation index template.

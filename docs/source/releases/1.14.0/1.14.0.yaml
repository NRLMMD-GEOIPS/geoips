    We still need to fix the pdf doc build, but turning it off temporarily until

  description: |
    *From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

    Since version releases often have corrections to RST release notes, do not fail
    on RST release note check within version release branches.

    No longer deleting YAML files or checking in rst files - store
    all release notes as YAML in perpetuity, and auto-generate the
    rst with brassy every time. This will make rolling back releases
    MUCH easier.

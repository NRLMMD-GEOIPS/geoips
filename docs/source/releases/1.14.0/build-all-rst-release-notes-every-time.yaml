- title: 'Build RST release notes from YAML files every time'
  description: |
    *From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

    Rather than generating and checking in RST files with
    each release, save all the original YAML files and produce
    RST every time from within build_docs.sh.

    Store the release notes in X.Y.Z directories, producing
    X.Y.Z.rst during the build_docs process. Update the index.rst
    generating code to support either vX_Y_Z.rst or X.Y.Z.rst
    filename format.

    This allows simply moving the 'latest' release note directory
    to X.Y.Z during the release process, and maintaining a record
    of all the original release notes in perpetuity, facilitating
    rapid release roll backs or evaluation of previous release notes.

    Note we also now ignore an 'upcoming' release note directory,
    as that is a temporary location to store the release note for
    the upcoming release during the version release process for
    the current version ('latest').  At the end of the release
    process, the 'upcoming' directory will be moved to 'latest'
    to prepare for the next release.

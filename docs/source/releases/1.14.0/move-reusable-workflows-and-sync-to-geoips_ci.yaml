- title: 'Move reusable workflows and sync files to geoips_ci'
  description: |
    *From issue GEOIPS#562: 2024-08-15, version update*

    Create a new repository, geoips_ci, that will manage all GeoIPS Ecosystem 
    reusable workflows, as well as files to sync to all GeoIPS plugin
    repositories.

    Simplify brassy-notes and tag-and-release to filter on pr merged immediately
    (rather than trying to pass pr merged flag into reusable workflow). These should
    never run on a closed but not merged PR.

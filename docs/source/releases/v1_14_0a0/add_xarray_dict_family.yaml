bug fix:
- description: |
    *From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

    Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
    passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
    a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
    the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
    to curr_products when output file list not defined.

    This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
    it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
    (followed a different route through the code for each).

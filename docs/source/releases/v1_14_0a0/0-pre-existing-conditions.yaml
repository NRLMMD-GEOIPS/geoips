bug-fix:
- description: |
    Correct typo causing product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist failure. Product
    families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data passed
    unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to a missing
    else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when the output file
    list was not pre-defined. Add else statement to set final_products to curr_products
    when output file list not defined. This resolved an error with product family
    xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when it was requested without sectoring, but it
    worked if sectoring was requested (followed a different route through the code for
    each).

    Fix failing test data CLI unit tests. `test_geoips_config_install.py` and
    `test_log_setup.py` had 1 or more tests that were failing, which caused the CI to
    fail as well. Fix these unit tests so we can actually use the CI to address problems
    that are coming from new PRs.

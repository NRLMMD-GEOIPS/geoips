Refactoring Updates:

    *From GEOIPS#576: 2024-05-11, CLI: Reduce number of command layers where possible and appropriate*
    *From GEOIPS#573: 2024-05-11, Use class factories to generate subcommands for commands like ``geoips get family`` and ``geoips get interface``*

    While this PR doesn't fix all of the problems addressed in the issues above, it is our
    initial attempt at creating a class factory for certain CLI commands to reduce the
    verbage needed to execute those commands. Spefically in this branch, we've addressed the
    command class ``GeoipsListSingleInterface``. We now use the aforementioned class as a
    base class to build ``GeoipsListSingleInterface<interface_name>`` classes at runtime.

    By doing so, we can now run ``geoips list <interface_name>`` rather than
    ``geoips list interface <interface_name>``. This improves the readability of this
    command and makes it much easier to type via the CLI. We expect in future PRs to address
    similar commands, such as ``geoips get family <family_name>`` and
    ``geoips get plugin <interface_name> <plugin_name>`` for the reasons mentioned
    previously.

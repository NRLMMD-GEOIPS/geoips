v1.2.4: 2021-11-12, original_source_filename->original_source_filenames, simplify setup

Breaking Interface Changes

Breaking Test Repo Updates
==========================

* Replaced original_source_filename attribute with list of original_source_filenames

    * Updated all metadata YAML outputs

Improvements
============

* Automatically check command line args (including filenames) before attempting processing
* Assume standard geoips_conda installation for standard config_geoips usage

    * Simplifies config files
    * Still allows individuals to override functionality and use their own environment

* Simplified README installation steps

    * Create base_install_and_test.sh script that handles complete consistent conda-based geoips installation
    * remove "active_branch" (assume dev)

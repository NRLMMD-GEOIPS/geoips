Bug Fixes
=========

Rethink implementation of Plugin Registry Validation
----------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#526: 2024-04-29, Move test_interfaces out of geoips/commandline and into tests directory*

This stems from *GEOIPS#442: 2024-04-16, Move PyTest functionality from PluginRegistry Class to Unit Tests*,
which moved all pytest-dependent functions of the PluginRegistry class to a separate
unit test. We missed a reference to this validation in
``geoips/commandline/test_interfaces.py`` which ended up failing due to the moved
functions. We now invoke the ``import_optional_dependencies`` function in
``geoips/context_managers.py`` to implement this validation, and if the user does not
have pytest installed, we just don't validate the PluginRegistry and continue to
interface testing. We probably should discuss this a bit more, to see if we want to
refactor the unit tests to not use pytest for validation, or if it is fine leaving it
as-is.

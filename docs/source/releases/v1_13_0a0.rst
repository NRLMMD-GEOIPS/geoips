Created Interface for Text-Based Plugins
----------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#492: 2024-04-12, Need to Address Text-Based Plugins*
Related PRs:
* *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/data_fusion#32: 2024-04-24, replaced all occurences of
  ``matplotlib_linear_norm`` with ``linear_norm``*

While there are not many, GeoIPS has some text-based plugins which currently do not have
a supporting interface. Currently, we only have ascii palettes implemented as text based
plugins, and in truth, we do not treat them as we do other GeoIPS Plugins. Instead, the
ascii palettes defined in these plugins are used in tandom alongside GeoIPS Colormappers
to correctly get and apply the palette.

To prepare GeoIPS to be able to handle other types of text based plugins, we've decided
to create a Text-Based Interface which can handle text plugins. This Interface acts
similarly to both Yaml and Module based interfaces, and has functionality such as
``get_plugin`` and ``get_plugins``. This PR only supports ``ascii palette``
text plugins, but was structured in a manner that could support other types of text
plugins in the future.

``ascii_palette`` plugins have a ``colormap`` attrubute, which is a
``Matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap`` which was created based on the ascii palette
defined in the plugins source file. This ``colormap`` attribute can then be used
alongside a colormapper to correctly apply the ascii palette to a certain output.

A large number of the yaml files below were modified because we've renamed colormapper
``matplotlib_linear_norm`` to ``linear_norm`` instead. We did this because the original
name was inaccurate, as that colormapper didn't just produce matplotlib-based colormaps.

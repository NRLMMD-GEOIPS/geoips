Enhancements
============

Initial Stage of the GeoIPS CLI
-------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#37: 2022-08-11, Create a useful CLI for GeoIPS.*

GeoIPS currently runs off of a few command scripts scattered throughout the code. The
only way a user could discover this is by reading the documentation, or looking through
the pyproject.toml to discover what scripts/commands are executable at the commandline.

To fix this, we are beginning to implement a new GeoIPS CLI, which will be called via
``geoips <command> <sub-command>``. This will allow the user to easily query and/or
execute geoips without having extensive knowledge of the lower-level implementations of
GeoIPS.

Currently, the GeoIPS CLI implements config, get, list, run, and validate commands. We
expect that we will change how ``run`` works, as well as add additional commands such as
``test``.

You can find more detailed information about each command at
``geoips/geoips/commandline/ancillary_info/cmd_instructions.yaml``. Below, we'll detail
to a minimal extent what each command does.

``geoips config`` implements configuration commands which are used to modify and/or
set up your GeoIPS environment. Currently, we implement installation methods for
downloading and decompressing test datasets. This is called via
``geoips config install <test_dataset_name>``.

``geoips get`` implements a variety of commands which retrieve additional information
about GeoIPS artifacts. Artifacts are a high level term for software pieces implemented
throughout GeoIPS. This includes individual plugins, interfaces, families, and top-level
packages.

``geoips list`` implements a variety of list methods which are used to detail what
artifacts exist throughout the GeoIPS Environment, or at a package specific level. We
currently support listing an individual interface, available interfaces, implemented
interfaces in a certain/all package[s], packages, scripts, and test-datasets.

``geoips run`` is an easy way to run a certain test script contained within a GeoIPS
package. These scripts must be placed in the ``<pkg_name>/tests/scripts`` directory and
be implemented via a ``*.sh`` bash script. This is an easier method to run your test
scripts opposed to traversing to the explicit directory and running the bash script
manually. We expect this command will change greatly as we continue to develop the CLI
and implement the order based procflow.

``geoips test`` implements a few methods to run testing scattered throughout GeoIPS
and other GeoIPS packages. It functions similar to run, but instead of being limited
to just executing normal test scripts, we can also run integration tests, liniting,
and unit tests. Since we expect ``geoips run`` to change in the future, we've
implemented this command to execute testing protocols for the foreseeable future.

``geoips validate`` implements a simple method of validating a certain plugin found
at the specified filepath. We expect this command will do more in the future, but for
the meantime, this command will validate the plugin using the associated interface
defined in the aforementioned plugin.

For an example of how to run the GeoIPS CLI, see the code section below.
.. code-block:: bash

    # Install the test_data_clavrx Test Dataset from CIRA's Nextcloud Instance
    geoips config install test_data_clavrx
    # All Interfaces GeoIPS and other GeoIPS Packages will be listed including all of
    # The plugin names that exist in that type of interface
    geoips list interface algorithms
    # Retrieve the 'single_channel' algorithm plugin and output information related
    # to it
    geoips get plugin algorithms single_channel
    # Will run the script under <script_name>.sh as it would execute ./<script_name>.sh
    # run_procflow command in the corresponding tests/scripts directory
    geoips run geoips abi.static.Infrared.imagery_annotated.sh
    # Example of how to validate a specific plugin
    geoips validate /home/evan/geoips/geoips_packages/geoips/geoips/plugins/yaml/products/abi.yaml

New Docs Structure + GitHub Actions
-----------------------------------

Created a new folder, docs/new-docs, for updated documentation structure. A new doc8
linting action will only check the contents of this folder. Additionally, a new action
ensures that the "old docs" (all other docs except docs/new-docs) remain unchanged. All
new documentation should be added to new-docs. Development will now occur in new-docs
rather than a feature branch. Added a banner to the documentation site to inform readers
that the old docs are frozen and to link them to the new docs as a preview. Note that no
new functionality has been added to GeoIPS.

Documentation
=============

Ported Over Contributors / Git Workflow Documentation
------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#617: 2024-05-28, Documentation: Adding Functionality*

With the recent merge of docs/new-docs, we are largely updating all of our GeoIPS
documentation. This specific branch handles porting over the documentation wrote in
``devguide/contributors.rst`` and ``devguide/git_workflow.rst`` to
``new-docs/contribute/adding-functionality/``. This was largely a copy-edit update,
however there were some minor updates to both ``contributors.rst`` and
``git_workflow.rst`` that expanded on how to reach out to GeoIPS Members and to check
for issues that have been created and/or are already in progress.

This branch updated ``docs/source/new-docs/index.rst`` to use a ``toctree`` to point
towards what documentation has already been wrote, but I'm happy to revert those changes
if we prefer an alternate format. This branch also commented out nearly all of
``devguide/contributors.rst`` and ``devguide/git_workflow.rst`` so the new documentation
under ``new-docs/contribute/adding-functionality`` didn't conflict with the embedded
references set in their documentation. We'll likely remove the ``devguide``
documentation once ``new-docs`` is complete in its entirety.

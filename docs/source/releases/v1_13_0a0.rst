Refactoring Updates
===================

Removed all support for Python versions less than 3.10.0
--------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#439: 2024-02-12, Remove Support for Python 3.9*

'There are a few places in the code where we explicitly attempt to support Python 3.9
but supporting 3.9 is beginning to hold us back in some ways. We should explicitly
remove support for Python 3.9 and update the code to remove all related special cases.'

Since Python 3.9 and older versions are holding GeoIPS back, and since primary GeoIPS
users are using Python versions greater than or equal to 3.10.0, we are removing all
support for versions less than 3.10. The following files have been modified to
implement those changes.

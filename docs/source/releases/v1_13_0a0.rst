Documentation
=============

Developer Asisted Package Creation
----------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#507: 2024-04-24, Documentation Guideline for Developer-Assisted Package Creation*

The aforementioned issue illustrates the need for a guideline which documents why,
when, and how developers should work alongside users and researchers to get their
geospatial data processing routines integrated alongside GeoIPS. Namely, here at CIRA,
this is a large task for GeoIPS developers. We are expected to work alongside
researchers to get their routines integrated alongside GeoIPS, and having this
documentation layed out should streamline this process.

The created guideline illustrates why we do this, what use cases we'll support, and what
information we as developers will need to generate a standalone package containing the
researchers' geospatial data processing routines into a GeoIPS Package.

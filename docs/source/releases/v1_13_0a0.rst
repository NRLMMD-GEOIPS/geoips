Enhancements
============

Update Plugins to Support Better Plotting Configurability
---------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#259: 2023-08-11, Update product/product_default schemas to allow for greater plotting configurability*
*From GEOIPS#147: 2023-04-05, Add support for label positioning*

This enhancement updates feature / gridline -annotator yaml plugins and imagery-based
module plugins to enhance the plotting configurability we can control as users within
GeoIPS. It adds quite a few new attributes which we can use to control our plotting
output. This includes:
* Background color for data over the map-portion of the image (feature_annotator)
* Background color for the frame-portion of the image (gridline_annotator)
* x label offset (gridline_annotator)
* y label offset (gridline_annotator)
* font family for labels (gridline_annotator)
* font style for labels ('italic', 'bold', etc.) (gridline_annotator)
* font size for labels (in pixels) (gridline_annotator)

To change the background of a frame, all you need to do is add a
``background: <mpl_color_name>`` property within your gridline_annotator plugin. To
modify the background color of the mapped portion of the image, you'll add the same
section to your feature_annotator.

To change the offset of the labels for applicable imagery outputs, all you need to do is
add an ``xpadding: <pixel_offset_int>`` and/or a ``ypadding: <pixel_offset_int>`` to the
``labels`` portion of your gridline annotator. Using this information, we will adjust
the offset of your tick labels to the desired position.

To modify the font-based aspects of labels, you can do any of the following:
* ``fontfamily: <font_name>``
* ``fontstyle: <style_name>``
* ``fontsize: <float>``

For examples of these new features, look at ``feature_annotator: default_oldlace`` and
``gridline_annotator: default_palegreen``.

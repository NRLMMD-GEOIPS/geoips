Enhancements
============

Update Plugins to Support Better Plotting Configurability
---------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#259: 2023-08-11, Update product/product_default schemas to allow for greater plotting configurability*
*From GEOIPS#147: 2023-04-05, Add support for label positioning*

This enhancement updates feature / gridline -annotator yaml plugins and imagery-based
module plugins to enhance the plotting configurability we can control as users within
GeoIPS. It adds new functionality, such as controlling the background color for the
map and frame in imagery, and also adds functionality which can control label
positioning within your imagery. To change the background of a frame, all you need to
do is add a ``background: <mpl_color_name>`` property within your gridline_annotator
plugin. To modify the background color of the mapped portion of the image, you'll add
the same section to your feature_annotator.

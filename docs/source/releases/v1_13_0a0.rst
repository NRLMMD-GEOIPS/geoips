Enhancements
============

Added 'expose' command
----------------------

*From GEOIPS#274: 2023-08-19, Add useage to setup.sh for command discovery*

The aforementioned issue requested that we add functionality to expose all commands
available in the GeoIPS environment. Rather than adding this functionality to setup.sh,
I've decided to add another function to geoips_utils.py which will expose all GeoIPS
commands in a tabular format. This will work for any new command added in the future as
well. This function adds two new dependencies, ``toml`` and ``tabulate``, though
``tabulate`` is added as a dependency to the CLI PRs anyways.

To use this new function, reinstall GeoIPS via ``pip install -e .``, and run the command
``expose``.

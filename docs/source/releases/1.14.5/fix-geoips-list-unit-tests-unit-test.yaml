bug fix:
- title: 'Allow command line tests for editable and non-editable installs'
  description: |
    Previously non-editable installs would fail the commandline-based unit tests.
    Ensure editable and non-editable installs both pass.  GitHub Actions workflows
    should be updated to test both editable and non-editable installs, as appropriate.

    Note LOG.warnings were added to the geoips_list_unit_tests unit test when the
    unit-test directory does not exist, in addition to the xfail.  Currently we
    are planning to xfail when unit-test directory does not exist.

- title: 'Check if unit-tests folder exists when determining if it exists.'
  description: |
    Previously this checked if the length of the list of package_names was 1 to
    determine if the unit-tests folder existed.  I don't think that is correct.
    Instead, check if os.path.exists on the unit-tests folder, and if it does not
    exist, raise an error that the unit-tests folder does not exist.

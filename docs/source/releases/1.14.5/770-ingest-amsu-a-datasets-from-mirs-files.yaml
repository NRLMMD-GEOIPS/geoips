bug fix:
- title: 'Replace AMSU-B references with MHS, and update MIRS netCDF reader'
  description: |
    The amsub_mirs reader was a bit misleading. AMSU-B has not been around since 2005,
    and has been replaced with the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS). The MIRS files
    read in by the amsub_mirs reader actually contains both AMSU-A and MHS data, but
    the reader only read in the MHS channels. In addition to updating this reader to
    ingest the AMSU-A data, we made the decision to replace all references of AMSU-B
    with MHS. This was also reflected in the product YAMLs, and therefor the test
    scripts as well.

    The amsub_mirs reader was renamed to amsua_mhs_mirs to better reflect which data
    are being ingested, and sets the top-level metadata source name to amsu-a_mhs. To
    make this all the more complicated, in order to have the correct source name listed
    in the file name and title, the reader will change the source name to either amsu-a
    or mhs at the dataset level. i.e. The source name in METADATA.attrs will always be
    amsu-a_mhs, AMSUA.attrs will be amsu-a, and MHS.attrs will be mhs. Due to this
    switching, we had to add amsu-a_mhs as a source input to all amsu-a and mhs product
    yaml files.

    There was no problem with implementing the varying dataset source name in the single
    source procflow, but it did cause issues with the config based procflow. The config
    based procflow relies on checking the top level METADATA to get the product plugin.
    To solve this problem, we added the ability to loop through all datasets and check
    each source name. This was only a problem in two locations, and while the solution
    implemented in this pull request works this functionality should really be toggled
    (e.g. if METADATA.source_name == multi)

    An mhs product YAML previously existed, but it was not actually used. This PR
    renames the amsu-b product YAML as mhs, and replaces all the contents of the old
    mhs product YAML.

    Also add a new amsu-a product - currently only supports the RainRate product.

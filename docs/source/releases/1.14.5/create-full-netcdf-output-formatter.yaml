enhancement:
- title: 'Add full netcdf output formatter'
  description: |
    To support outputting a full dataset in netcdf format (without
    regard for specific geoips attributes, variables, etc), create
    a new output formatter that just writes out the entire xarray
    dataset as is.  This is useful for things like reprojecting a
    dataset to a given domain, without any algorithms, etc applied.

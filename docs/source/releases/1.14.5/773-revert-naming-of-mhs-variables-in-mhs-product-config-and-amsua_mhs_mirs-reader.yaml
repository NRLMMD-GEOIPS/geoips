bug fix:
- title: 'Revert naming of MHS variables'
  description: |
    Revert naming of MHS variables in mhs product config and amsua_mhs_mirs reader.
    Having the variables named as MHS_Chan<N>_AT instead of Chan<N>_AT was causing
    issues with other plugins, such as recenter_tc. We should keep the old naming
    style for now, at least.

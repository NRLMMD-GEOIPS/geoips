bug fix:
- title: 'Close ABI netcdf file object after reading'
  description: |
    ABI netcdf files were opened for reading, but never closed.
    Ignoring the terrible practice, while this may have worked 
    with netcdf4<1.7.0, this likely has been causing issues with 
    config based processing using netcdf4>1.7.0. In certain config
    based procflows too many netcdf file objects were left open
    after reading in the requested data, causing Python to crash.
    This error was very difficult to track down, and this explanation
    is only a hunch based off this error that only popped up once
    out of many, many tests -
    > 19_224022   abi_netcdf.py 720     INFO: Only need metadata from first file, returning
    > There are 835 HDF5 objects open!
    > Report: open objects on 72057594037927942
    > 28322 Segmentation fault      (core dumped)
    
    No segfaults have been observed after closing the netcdf file,
    so thinking this was the source of the error.

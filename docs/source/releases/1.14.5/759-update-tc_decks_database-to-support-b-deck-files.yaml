bug fix:
- title: 'Add support for adding b-deck files to TC tracks database'
  description: |
    The update_tc_tracks_database previously only supported G-Deck files, which are
    not available outside NRL. This commandline utility/database should support tracking
    B-Deck files. The files are largely similar, biggest difference relates to the index
    of the storm name between the two files, and how lat/lon values are stored in the
    files.

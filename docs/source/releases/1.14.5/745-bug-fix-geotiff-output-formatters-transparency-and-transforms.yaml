bug fix:
  - title: "Correct transparency and transform issues with cogeotiff output format"
    description: |
      Fix projection problems so we have full global coverage, and can create geotiffs
      of sectors that cross the dateline

      * Allowing longlat projection, and ensuring the full -180 to 180 range to
        get rid of the missing data at the dateline
      * Allowing longlat projection, and specifying an alternate prime meridian
        in the area_definitions (geoips YAML sector), so that we do NOT cross
        the dateline when creating the geotiff projection. GeoTIFF does not
        like going outside -180 to 180, whatever the center of your projection
        is. We just made the center of our projection the center of our sector
      * Use area_def CRS for longlat, and EPSG:4326 for eqc projection.
      * Just use a direct explicitly defined Affine transformation, instead of
        trying to use the translate method with 1/2 resolution, etc. I think
        this also helped the range be more exact. so we didn't lose data at the
        IDL.
      * Update filename formatter so degree-based projections use
        resolution * 111km for the filenames

      Fix masked values over Africa and ensure proper masking off-disk

      * Fixed scaling - off by one errors...
      * Explicitly set missing value, and added some arguments to make sure the
        COG writer actually used it.

bug fix:
  - title: "ABI netcdf non-resampled read ROI and sat zen cutoff same as resampled"
    description: |
      Previously there was no sat zenith cut off for abi non-resampled reads,
      and ROI was not applied consistently with resampled

      update non-resampled to use ROI factor of 5 to match resampled reads.

      update sat zenith cutoff for non-resampled reads to 75 to match resampled.

      I don't think this actually works 100%.  May need to adjust slightly.

refactor:
  - title: "Consolidate geotiff output formatters"
    description: |
      Have cogeotiff_rgba and geotiff_standard both call cogeotiff.  Eventually
      probably delete these, unless we find there is a benefit to having the
      ability to explicitly request no-cog (geotiff_standard), or explicitly
      request RGBA (auto-detected in cogeotiff)

bug fix:
- title: 'Fix bug preventing invest b-deck files from being added to decks database'
  description: |
    Fix bug that was preventing b-deck invest files from being added to the TC decks
    database. The regular expression check for b-deck files was only supporting
    named storm files and not invests, which contain the storm start time in
    the deck file name.

    Also add error handling if either a b-deck or g-deck file cannot be parsed and added
    to the decks database.

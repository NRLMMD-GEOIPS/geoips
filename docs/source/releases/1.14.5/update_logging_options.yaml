enhancement:
  - title: "Allow setting log format strings via base_paths/config"
    description: |
      Move GEOIPS_LOGGING_LEVEL to geoips/filenames/base_paths.py (which will
      eventually be the geoips config), and add GEOIPS_LOGGING_DATFMT_STRING
      and GEOIPS_LOGGING_FMT_STRING for making the logging output format fully
      configurable. Maintain the same defaults, and allow passing in an explicit
      string now rather than using the "verbose" keyword arg (which was a bool,
      and mapped to one of 2 format strings).

      Now just default to None in args, so the defaults are pulled from gpaths in
      log_setup.py directly.

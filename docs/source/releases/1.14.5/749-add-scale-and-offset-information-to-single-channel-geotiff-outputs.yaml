enhancement:
  - title: "Support scale and offset information in cogeotiff output formatter"
    description: |
      Ensure scale and offset information is appropriately included in GeoTIFF
      output to support obtaining physical values from the resulting COG.  This
      will allow creating 8 bit GeoTIFFs, and still retrieving actual reflectances,
      brightness temperatures, etc from the GeoTIFF.

      Update cogeotiff.py to retrieve the appropriate scaling information from
      the product YAMLs, and write it to the GeoTIFF.

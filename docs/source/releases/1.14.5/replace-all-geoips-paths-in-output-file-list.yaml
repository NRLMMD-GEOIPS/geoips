bug fix:
- title: 'Replace all geoips paths in output file list, not just GEOIPS_OUTDIRS'
  description: |
    Use existing GeoIPS utility, replace_geoips_paths, in order to ensure
    all paths are replaced in the output file list, and not just
    GEOIPS_OUTDIRS.

    Also, ensure the same env vars are replaced in check_output_file_list.sh as are
    replaced in replace_geoips_paths (not just GEOIPS_OUTDIRS)

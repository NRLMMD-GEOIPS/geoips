    Resolve algorithm_interpolator_colormapper typo in single_source procflow
    Pass in xarray.Dataset() rather than alg_xarray as the "interp_xarray" to
    the "perform_interpolation" function. Previously the xarray was not being
    interpolated, because it thought the alg_xarray was the pre-interpolated array.
    This bug was introduced when refactoring single source to avoid
    re-interpolating.  We should probably add an integration test for this
    product family.

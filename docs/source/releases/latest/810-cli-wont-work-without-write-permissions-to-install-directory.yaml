enhancement:
- title: 'Write cached json files to GEOIPS_CACHE_DIR'
  description: |
    The CLI was not usable when installed by a user other than the user running the CLI.
    This was because the CLI writes cached json files and was writing them into the install
    directory. This PR introduces GEOIPS_CACHE_DIR which defaults to platformdirs.user_cache_dir().
    It also reorganizes a bit to move the caching functions to geoips/utils for use by other
    code. This will also be used by the plugin registry. Note, this also adds a new formal
    dependency on platformdirs, however, this was already a dependency of other dependencies.

    Changed boolean check for whether or not release notes have been added
    to fix bug where the check for nesessary yaml files would pass 
    unexpectedly. Additionally, changed check to prevent manual editing of 
    release files to fail on changes to any `*.rst` files in 
    `docs/source/release/` instead of just `latest.rst` in the same path.

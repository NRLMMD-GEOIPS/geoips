enhancement:
- title: 'Support creating interfaces in new plugin packages'
  description: |
    This update includes refactoring and some minor enhancements to the plugin registry
    and pydantic code to allow new interfaces to be created on plugin packages outside
    of GeoIPS. For a plugin package to do so, they have to register their pyproject.toml
    in a separate namespace from 'geoips.plugin_packages'. For example, if you had a
    package named 'splunk' and wanted to create interfaces to support functionality
    not implemented in GeoIPS, you'd register your pyproject.toml under the
    'splunk.plugin_packages' namespace. GeoIPS can make use of any of these
    new interfaces (though if it needed to, we'd just implement it in GeoIPS) while
    'splunk' can still make use of GeoIPS' interfaces and plugins.

    All packages that fall under the 'splunk' namespace can also make use of 'splunk's'
    new interface functionality, and make use of GeoIPS' functionality. If a developer
    tries to create new interfaces under the 'geoips.plugin_packages' namespace, this
    will not work and GeoIPS will still be unaware of the new interface implemented in
    that plugin package.

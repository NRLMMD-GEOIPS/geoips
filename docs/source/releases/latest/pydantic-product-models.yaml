enhancement:
- title: 'Pydantic Product Models'
  description: |
    Added new pydantic models for product and product default plugins. These are the
    last remaining yaml-based plugins that needed to be converted over to pydantic.

    Additionally, added unit tests for these models that reach 100% coverage. Still need
    to do some tweaking to those tests, since the way products were set up, it seems
    pydantic fails in the incorrect model, although the failure is in fact correct. Need
    to sort this out.

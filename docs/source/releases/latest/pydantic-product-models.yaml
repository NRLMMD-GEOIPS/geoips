enhancement:
- title: 'OBP Pydantic Product / Product Default Models'
  description: |
    Adds new pydantic models used to validate product and product_default plugins. These
    updates are intended to completely replace the JSON schema we currently use to
    validate yaml-based plugins. Minor changes were needed to be made to
    geoips/pydantic/bases.py to take into account the differences in product plugins.

    Additionally, this update adds unit testing for these new models, and updated the
    .gitignore file to ignore both types of our plugin registry files (.json, .yaml).
  files:
    added:
      - geoips/pydantic/products.py
      - tests/unit_tests/pydantic/product_defaults/test_cases_bad.yaml

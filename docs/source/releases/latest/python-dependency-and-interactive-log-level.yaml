- title: 'Python Dependency and INTERACTIVE Log Level Updates'
  description: |
    This PR makes small updates to the minimum python version GeoIPS supports and the
    logging level that is associated with INTERACTIVE mode. GeoIPS now only supports
    python versions >= 3.11.0. Additionally, we updated the numeric value of the
    INTERACTIVE log level to be 25 rather than 35 so that LOG.WARNING output (35) will
    still be shown in our logs.

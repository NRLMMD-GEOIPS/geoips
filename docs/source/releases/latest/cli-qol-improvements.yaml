- title: 'CLI QOL Improvements'
  description: |
    Made various quality of life (QOL) improvements to the CLI for the upcoming GeoIPS
    tutorial. This PR updated both `geoips list test-datasets`` and `geoips config
    install` to include information on the file sizes of the remote test datasets.

    `geoips config install` now asks the user whether or not they want to install one
    or more datasets after they've seen the size of the compressed file. `geoips list
    test-datasets` includes an additional column containing the file sizes of each
    remote test dataset.

    Other changes include spelling fixes, and updates to the format of any `geoips
    describe`. Formatting changes make output info (namely docstrings) much cleaner.

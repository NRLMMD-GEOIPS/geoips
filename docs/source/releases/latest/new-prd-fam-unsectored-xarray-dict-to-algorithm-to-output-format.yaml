    Added support for a new a new product/product_defaults family called
    unsectored_xarray_dict_to_algorithm_to_output_format. Additionally, modified output
    formatter plugin 'unprojected_image' for 3D data. If 3D data is specified, then this
    output formatter will produce a series of 2D slices for each level of the 3D data.

    While family 'unsectored_xarray_dict_to_algorithm_to_output_format' was referenced
    in single_source.py, there was no actual schema that supported this family.
    Therefore, we've created that new schema, and updated parts of single_source to
    support using the 'unprojected_image' output formatter for this new family. All in
    all, by making use of these changes, we can avoid using the procflow arguments
    'self_register_dataset' and 'self_register_source', which would reproject geospatial
    datasets onto themselves. This was inefficent, and depending on the size of the
    dataset, could add close to another minute of processing to your workflow.

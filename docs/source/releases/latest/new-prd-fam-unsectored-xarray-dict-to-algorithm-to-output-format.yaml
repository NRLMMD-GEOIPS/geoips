    This branch supports a new product/product_defaults family called
    unsectored_xarray_dict_to_algorithm_to_output_format. While this family was
    referenced in single_source.py, there was no actual schema that supported this
    family. Therefore, we've created that new schema, and updated parts of single_source
    to support using the 'unprojected_image' output formatter for this new family. All
    in all, by making use of these changes, we can avoid using the procflow arguments
    'self_register_dataset' and 'self_register_source', which would reproject geospatial
    datasets onto themselves. This was inefficent, and depending on the size of the
    dataset, could add close to another minute of processing to your workflow.

bug fix:
- title: 'seviri_hrit bug fix'
  description: |
    The seviri_hrit reader had a bug caused by meteosat second generation High
    Resolution Visible (HRV) files. With our new reader updates which allow
    geostationary readers to handle multiple scan times, we broke the method in which
    this reader filtered out HRV files. The functionality was the same, but when
    seviri_hrit:call_single_time was fed a singular file, and that file was HRV, an
    error would occur in 'get_top_level_metadata'. This is due to the fact that we feed
    in files to 'call_single_time' individually the first time around to get a list of
    start datetimes, so we know which files to group together. We need to do the
    filtering before we call 'call_single_time', and things will work as expected.

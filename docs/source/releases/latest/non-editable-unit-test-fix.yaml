bug fix:
- title: 'Non-Editable Unit Test Fix'
  description: |
    @mindyls pointed out that the 'geoips list unit-tests' unit-test module was failing
    when one or more package was installed in non-editable mode. This wasn't caught by
    our github actions as we install packages in editable mode for testing. We should
    probably change this to test in both modes for the future.

    This PR updated some of the commandline unit test code, specifically for
    non-editable mode cases, to fix these failing tests. All commandline unit tests on
    my end are now passing.

bug fix:
- description: |
    When installing GeoIPS on a machine with only python3 (and not python)
    we get ``WARNING: 'python --version' failed, please install python >= 3.9 before proceeding``
    because the code looks for ``python`` explicitly. Some Linux distributions decided during 
    the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 that python should always refer to Python 2, 
    and the command to run Python 3 would be python3 with a 3 at the end. Debian and Ubuntu did this.
    This change adds a message to users informing them how they can change their
    system so calls to ``python`` are re-routed to their local ``python3``.

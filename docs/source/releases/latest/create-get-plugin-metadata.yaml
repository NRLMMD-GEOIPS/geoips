enhancement:
- title: 'Get Plugin Metadata'
  description: |
    Added a new method to all interfaces which retrieves the top level metadata for any
    given plugin. It does not actually load in the plugin, rather it makes use of the
    registry to gather the plugin's associated metadata.

    This is useful for quick validation of the base information supplied by plugins, and
    may also be used by the order based procflow.

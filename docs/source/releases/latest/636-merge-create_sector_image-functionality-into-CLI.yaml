    *From GEOIPS#636: 2024-06-05, Merge create_sector_image.py functionality into the CLI*

    This update moves the functionality from the independent console script
    ``create_sector_image`` onto the CLI under the command ``geoips test sector``. Since the
    CLI has been added to main, we are slowly consolidating all independent console scripts
    onto the CLI, so we have a uniform was of executing console commands with GeoIPS.

    There was a slight modification to this command, as we now only allow one sector to
    be provided to this command instead of a list of sectors. This fits better with the
    nomenclature of the command and can be ran multiple times if the user wants to create
    multiple sector images.

    Unit tests have been added for this command as well.

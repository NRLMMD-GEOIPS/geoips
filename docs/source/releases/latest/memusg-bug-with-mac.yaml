bug fix:
- description: |
    This branch was needed as there was recently a bug introduced on Mac that would prevent
    any use of GeoIPS. This was introduced in geoips/utils/memusg.py, where a Process method
    was used that was only available on Linux, FreeBSD, SunOS. The method was
    ``Process.cpu_num`` and was used in tracking information about the CPU Count used during
    a certain GeoIPS Process. Unfortunately, this is unavailable on Mac and caused bugs when
    trying to run GeoIPS.

    To fix this, we added a ``platform.system() == Linux`` check for ``Process.cpu_num``
    calls which ensured that function would only be ran if on a Linux system. Otherwise skip
    that call and don't collect inforamation on that variable.

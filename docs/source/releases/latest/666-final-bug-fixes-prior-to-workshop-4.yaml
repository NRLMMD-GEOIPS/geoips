bug fix:
- description: |
    Update build_docs.sh to call brassy to auto-generate the release notes prior
    to doc build.

    Also add latest.rst to .gitignore because we will now auto-generate it within
    the doc build, so we do not want it explicitly changed within the repo.
  files:
    modified:
    - '.gitignore'
    - 'docs/build_docs.sh'
    - 'docs/source/releases/latest.rst'

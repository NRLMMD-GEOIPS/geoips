bug fix:
- description: |
    Update build_docs.sh to call brassy to auto-generate the release notes prior
    to doc build.

    Also from doc build, call new script to update the release note index to add a
    "latest" section if there are latest YAML release notes. We may want to use this
    script to add versioned sections to index.rst in the future as well, but
    for now it only auto-adds latest.

bug fix:
- title: 'self-register bugfix for geostationary readers'
  description: |
    The `abi_netcdf.py` reader had a bug which caused a KeyError when the
    `self_register` variable was set. This drew our attention to
    inconsistencies in the naming of the returned dictionary of xarray
    Datasets.
    The current behavior is: when `self_register` is set, it will always
    return a Dataset named `Full-Disk`. We feel this naming is inappropriate.
    The new behavior, implemented in this PR, is to return the Dataset named
    the same as the `self_register` variable, with all zoomed or subsampled
    data placed together.

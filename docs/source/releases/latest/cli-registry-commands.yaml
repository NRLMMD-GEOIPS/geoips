enhancement:
- title: 'CLI Registry Commands and minor CLI QOL Updates'
  description: |
    This update enhances the CLI by adding 3 new commands related to the plugin registry
    and additionally makes some quality of life (QOL) to the 'geoips config install'
    command. QOL improvements include adding a progress bar for data install and
    extraction. The three new commands that were added build off of the plugin registry
    updates included in branches 'south-china-sea-sector' and '945-plugin-registry-class'

    The new commands ('geoips config create-registries',
    'geoips config delete-registries', 'geoips list registries'), as their names
    suggest, create, delete, and list plugin registries found within a given namespace.
    You can filter the config commands via -n namespace and -p packages, and for the
    create command, you can also specify what file format you want to save to (-s). The
    list command additionally supports relative path versus absolute path. These
    commands replace 'create_plugin_registries', which has since been removed from
    the console scripts attribute of GeoIPS' pyproject.toml. Unit tests have been added
    for all new functionality.

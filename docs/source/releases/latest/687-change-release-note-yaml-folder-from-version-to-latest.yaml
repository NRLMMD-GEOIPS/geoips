    Moved the yaml release files from ``docs/source/release/v(version number)/*`` to ``docs/source/release/latest/*``, which now builds to ``latest.rst``.
    Added ``latest.rst`` because brassy does not automatically build .rst files at the moment. 
    Ideally, brassy would create ``latest.rst``, which could be pulled down and built into the docs locally.
    Without ``latest.rst`` the docs will not build. So adding a blank file serves as a placeholder until the CI automatically builds and commits a ``latest.rst`` file.
    Added latest to ``/docs/source/release/index.rst`` so docs build.
    The release note not edited check SHOULD NOT PASS, because.... it was edited 😄

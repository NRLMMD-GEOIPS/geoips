    *From GEOIPS#312: Bug Fix: Update geostationary readers to support multiple scan times*

    Geostationary readers previously could only handle one scan time per run through.
    This is a limiting factor to these readers and one or more scientists at CIRA needed
    these readers to be able to handle multiple scan times per use. We've made the
    corresponding updates to geostaionary readers that were requested could read
    multiple scan times. If this PR goes well, it might be a good idea to support this
    functionality on other readers in the future.

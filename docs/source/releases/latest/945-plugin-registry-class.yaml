refactor:
- title: 'Plugin Registry Class Updates'
  description: |
    Largely refactors base.py and plugin_registry.py to consolidate all registry
    functionality to the PluginRegistry class. The PluginRegistry class is responsible
    for collecting registries to create a top-level namespace registry, which
    encapsulates all of the plugin registries found within plugin packages that fall
    under such namespace. Additionally, the PluginRegistry class is responsible for
    creating or deleting registry files, as well as retrieving plugins and their
    metadata when requested from any interface. The PluginRegistry class can also
    rebuild registries at runtime if plugins or interfaces are missing.

    This update took a lot of the functionality contained in base.py and moved it to
    the PluginRegistry class. Essentially, <interface>.get_plugin is just a wrapper
    to a call to the plugin registry now.

    Additionally, this PR largely updated the test_plugin_registries.py unit test file
    to greatly increase coverage. Went from around 20% to 97% coverage. Minor changes to
    other unit test files were needed due to the changes made in this PR.

    At this point, GeoIPS can function as a utility package for other package to implement
    similar plugin functionality. Other packages can create new interfaces and plugins
    in a new namespace and they will be registered to that namespace. No one package can
    define or collect interfaces/plugins from the multiple namespaces.

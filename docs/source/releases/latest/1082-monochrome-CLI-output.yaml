enhancement:
- title: 'Add NO_COLOR Environment Variable to GeoIPS'
  description: |
    The GeoIPS CLI has a few commands which can produce output that is colored
    differently than most terminal text. We do this via the 'colorama' package, however,
    we did not have a setting to disable colored terminal output if wanted. We took in
    consideration what other software packages have implemented and decided to reinforce
    that standard by implementing a new 'NO_COLOR' environment variable. If set to True,
    then GeoIPS will no longer produce colored output via the terminal. Keep in mind
    that since this variable commonly used among software packages, setting NO_COLOR to
    True may impact packages outside the scope of GeoIPS. For example, when this
    variable is enabled, pytest will no longer color its terminal output.

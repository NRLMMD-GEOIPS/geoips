bug fix:
- title: 'Use filter="tar" in tarfile extract commands'
  description: |
    Update all uses of tarfile to use the filter="tar" option in extract commands.
    This prevents a number of different types of malicious tar files from being
    extracted. This will become default behavior in Python 3.14. This gets rid of a
    DeprecationWarning in lower versions of Python.

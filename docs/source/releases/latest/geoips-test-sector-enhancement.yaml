- title: 'GeoIPS Test Sector Enhancement'
  description: |
    The large update of this PR was centered at the command 'geoips test sector', where
    we modified that command to support sector overlays. Essentially, if you want to
    understand the geospatial domain of a certain sector, you can run
    'geoips test sector --overlay', and this will overlay your sector in a
    red-transparent fashion over the global sector. This is especially useful for very
    small sectors that might not provide much information when running the command as
    usual. To implement this, slight modifications were made to the CLI and larger
    updates were made to the SectorBasePlugin class.

    Other updates included replacing all underscores in optional CLI arguments with
    dashes. Lots of unit tests check the output of help commands, which explains why
    so many files were updated. This is just name changes and does not impact the
    functionality of the CLI at all.

    Lastly, removed irrelevant file that was out of date and out of scope.

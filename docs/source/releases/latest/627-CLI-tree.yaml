    *From GEOIPS#627: 2024-05-31, Add functionality to the CLI which prints out a tree of available commands*

    The GeoIPS CLI provides a variety of commands which aren't necessarily easily exposed
    via ``geoips -h``. To improve this issue, we've added a ``geoips tree`` command which
    exposes all GeoIPS CLI commands in a tree-like fashion. This way, we can expose all
    commands that are available via the GeoIPS CLI, and expose the depth in which these
    commands exist.

    By displaying the commands in a depthwise structure, users can understand what commands
    are available and how they are called.

    If you just call ``geoips tree``, you'll get the full command tree in a non-colored,
    verbose output.

    The output of running ``geoips tree`` is shown below.

    .. code-block:: bash

        geoips tree

        geoips
            geoips config
                geoips config install
            geoips get
                geoips get family
                geoips get interface
                geoips get package
                geoips get plugin
            geoips list
                geoips list interface
                geoips list interfaces
                geoips list packages
                geoips list plugins
                geoips list scripts
                geoips list test-datasets
                geoips list unit-tests
            geoips run
                geoips run single_source
                geoips run data_fusion
                geoips run config_based
            geoips test
                geoips test linting
                geoips test script
            geoips tree
            geoips validate

    ``geoips tree`` additionaly provides optional arguments to filter the output of this
    command. Shown below are these optional arguments and descriptions of what each argument
    does.

    * ``--color``

      * The output of ``geoips tree`` might be a little hard to interpret. If you want the
        output of ``geoips tree`` to be colored by depth, make sure to use the ``--color``
        flag. (Defaults to False)

    * ``--max-depth``

      * How many levels of the tree we'd like to expose. Defaults to two levels, which is
        shown above.

    * ``--short-name``

      * The output of ``geoips tree`` provides the full command string at each level. If you
        just want the literal command name and every level, make sure to provide this flag.
        (Defaults to False)

enhancement:
- title: 'Order Based -- Dealing with generated and non-registered workflow plugins'
  description: |
    This PR updates how we can call the order based procflow. Instead of only being able
    to provide a registered workflow plugin name to the commandline alongside other
    procflow arguments GeoIPS supports, we've now added two additional arguments in
    which we can specify a workflow. Those arguments are '--filepath' and '--generated'.

    Neither of these arguments represent a 'registered' workflow plugin. Generated means
    we're passing a literal evalation of a python dictionary (representing a workflow
    plugin), and filepath means we're passing a path to an unregistered workflow plugin.

    WorkflowPluginModel validation occurs for both of the new arguments and will only
    send the provided workflows to the order based procflow once validation has passed.
    Otherwise, appropriate errors will be raised.

    Unit tests and commandline help information have been updated to reflect the changes
    made in this PR.

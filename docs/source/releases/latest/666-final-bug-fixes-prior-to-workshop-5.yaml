bug fix:
- description: |
    Add pip install of plugin package to build_docs.sh to ensure package is
    installed before attempting to build API docs.

    Currently, build_docs.sh checks is the current package is installed, and if not
    it pip installs it.  In the future will likely just error, and assume the
    package is installed already if attempting to build documentation.

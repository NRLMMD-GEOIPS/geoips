Refactoring Updates:
- description: |
    *From GEOIPS#576: 2024-05-11, CLI: Reduce number of command layers where possible and appropriate*
    *From GEOIPS#573: 2024-05-11, Use class factories to generate subcommands for commands like ``geoips get family`` and ``geoips get interface``*

    This branch refactors commands which use the form of ``geoips get <interface_name>`` to
    make use of class factories. Before, we had to run commands such as:

    * ``geoips get interface <interface_name>``
    * ``geoips get family <interface_name> <family_name>``
    * ``geoips get plugin <interface_name> <family_name>``

    The aforementioned commands were overly verbose and needed some refactoring to reduce
    the levels required to execute a certain command. In this branch, we refactored
    ``GeoipsGetInterface`` to be a base command for ``get <interface_name>``,
    ``get <interface_name> family <family_name>``, and
    ``get <interface_name> <plugin_name>``. This resulted in the removal of
    ``GeoipsGetFamily`` and ``GeoipsGetPlugin`` and the refactoring of
    ``GeoipsGetInterface`` to include the functionality of those other commands. We can use
    class factories for each interface to execute these commands now.

    On top of this, we implemented aliases for a variety of CLI commands. For an exact
    listing of aliases available for each command, see
    ``geoips/commandline/ancillary_info/alias_mapping.yaml``, which includes aliases
    supported for each command. Now, we can run a verbose command such as:

    * ``geoips list algorithms -p geoips``

    and replace it with

    * ``geoips ls algs -p geoips``

    This also reduces the verbosity of certain CLI commands. Note, the unit tests have been
    modified to reflect these changes.

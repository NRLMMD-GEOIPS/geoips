enhancement:
- title: Enable full suite of integration tests to be run in parallel via pytest.
  description: 'This adds a helper python file with pytest-capable tests that call
    the same shell scripts called by full_test.sh. This is helpful when
    combined with pytest-xdist''s ability to run pytests in parallel.
    It also gives developers the ability to run tests with an alternative
    CLI output format. Users should continue to run full_test.sh.'

    *From GEOIPS#685: 2024-07-17, Fix unit test that will fail if any plugin packages with console scripts are installed*

    There are a few lingering bugs that need fixed before the workshop starts in August.
    These were relatively simple to fix so I merged three bug fixes into this PR.

    Bug #1 managed to stay in GeoIPS for a while, and resulted in duplicate log statements
    for every log level. This was caused by ``geoips.commandline.log_setup:setup_logging``
    and would result in ``LOG X (num times setup_logging called)`` per a program's execution.
    To fix this, I added two global variables in ``setup_logging``, once of which tests if
    that function has already been called, the second being a ``log`` variable that will be
    returned the first time, and every time after this function is called. With this update,
    we need to make sure that the lowest log-level requested should be called FIRST.
    Otherwise, it will be obfuscated by higher level log levels.

    Bug #2 was a simple fix, and was just a version change for Cartopy in pyproject.toml.
    There was a minor pixel difference in some tests outputs using version 0.22.0, so we
    updated this to gt=0.23.0.

    Bug #3 was a possible bug that was introduced by the expose command. There was a
    hardcoded portion of a unit test for that command that could result in failed tests
    if certain packages had console scripts. We've refactored this command to be dynamic,
    and now should pass no matter what packages are provided.

    Bug #4 was related to commandline instructions unit tests, specifically the tests
    that checked whether or not a file was newer than another file. These work locally,
    but git causes problems with the files write time and these tests sometimes fail.
    Since we are confident in the functionality of this code, we've decided to remove
    these unit tests for the time being.

    Remove all references to template_fusion_plugin.  No longer supporting
    template_fusion_plugin - only template_basic_plugin with very basic
    plugins, and geoips_plugin_example with more extensive examples.

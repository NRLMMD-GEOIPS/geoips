bug fix:
- title: 'Fix permissions bug'
  description: 'This is a small fix to the documentation building script that changes error handling for git repository validation. It updates code to handle git repos that are read only and not owned by the current user. Uses the slower but more robust pygit2 discover_repository function as backup when the normal class constructor fails. This unblocks documentation builds on all plugin repos for geoips.'

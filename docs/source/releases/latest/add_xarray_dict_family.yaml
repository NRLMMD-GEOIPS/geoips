    *From GEOIPS/geoips#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

    Ensure all xarray dict based product families are supported within the single
    source procflow, including sectored and unsectored dictionaries of xarrays,
    algorithm and no algorithm application, and with and without area defs. Note
    ALL are not supported, but better identified what is missing / supported now.

    *From GEOIPS/geoips#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

    Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
    passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
    a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
    the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
    to curr_products when output file list not defined.

    This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
    it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
    (followed a different route through the code for each).

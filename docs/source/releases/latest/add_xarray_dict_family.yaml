    *From GEOIPS/geoips#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

    Primary functional change

    * Only check for percentage pixel diffs with the thresholded call to pixelmatch
    * Only include exact check for purposes of reporting and outputing exact diff image.

    A few additional updates to help figure out the best way forward for comparison

    * Return immediately if the arrays are identical (avoid running pixelmatch)
    * Ensure we run exact and thresholded pixelmatch if the arrays are not identical
    * Output separate exact and thresholded diff images

    Ensure all xarray dict based product families are supported within the single
    source procflow, including sectored and unsectored dictionaries of xarrays,
    algorithm and no algorithm application, and with and without area defs. Note
    ALL are not supported, but better identified what is missing / supported now.

    *From GEOIPS/geoips#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

    Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
    passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
    a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
    the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
    to curr_products when output file list not defined.

    This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
    it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
    (followed a different route through the code for each).

    This test script unnecessarily requires test data. It was updated to skip
    the test if $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR doesn't exist, but then it would still fail if some
    test data was available, but not the test data required for the abi reader.
    Comment this test out altogether for now - we should create a new one at some
    point that does not require test data if we want to test the interactive logs
    from a directly imported plugin.

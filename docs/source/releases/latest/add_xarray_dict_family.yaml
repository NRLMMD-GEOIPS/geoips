    *For GEOIPS/geoips#666, 2024-07-30, workshop bug fixes*

    Ensure all xarray dict based product families are supported within the single
    source procflow, including sectored and unsectored dictionaries of xarrays,
    algorithm and no algorithm application, and with and without area defs. Note
    ALL are not supported, but better identified what is missing / supported now.

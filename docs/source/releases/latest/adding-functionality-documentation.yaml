    *From GEOIPS#617: 2024-05-28, Documentation: Adding Functionality*

    With the recent merge of docs/new-docs, we are largely updating all of our GeoIPS
    documentation. This specific branch handles porting over the documentation wrote in
    ``devguide/contributors.rst`` and ``devguide/git_workflow.rst`` to
    ``new-docs/contribute/adding-functionality/``. This was largely a copy-edit update,
    however there were some minor updates to both ``contributors.rst`` and
    ``git_workflow.rst`` that expanded on how to reach out to GeoIPS Members and to check
    for issues that have been created and/or are already in progress.

    This branch updated ``docs/source/new-docs/index.rst`` to use a ``toctree`` to point
    towards what documentation has already been wrote, but I'm happy to revert those changes
    if we prefer an alternate format. This branch also commented out nearly all of
    ``devguide/contributors.rst`` and ``devguide/git_workflow.rst`` so the new documentation
    under ``new-docs/contribute/adding-functionality`` didn't conflict with the embedded
    references set in their documentation. We'll likely remove the ``devguide``
    documentation once ``new-docs`` is complete in its entirety.

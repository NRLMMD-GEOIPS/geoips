    * *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/data_fusion#32: 2024-04-24, replaced all occurences of
      ``matplotlib_linear_norm`` with ``linear_norm``*

    While there are not many, GeoIPS has some text-based plugins which currently do not have
    a supporting interface. Currently, we only have ascii palettes implemented as text based
    plugins, and in truth, we do not treat them as we do other GeoIPS Plugins. Instead, the
    ascii palettes defined in these plugins are used in tandom alongside GeoIPS Colormappers
    to correctly get and apply the palette.

    To prepare GeoIPS to be able to handle other types of text based plugins, we've decided
    to create a Text-Based Interface which can handle text plugins. This Interface acts
    similarly to both Yaml and Module based interfaces, and has functionality such as
    ``get_plugin`` and ``get_plugins``. This PR only supports ``ascii palette``
    text plugins, but was structured in a manner that could support other types of text
    plugins in the future.

    ``ascii_palette`` plugins have a ``colormap`` attrubute, which is a
    ``Matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap`` which was created based on the ascii palette
    defined in the plugins source file. This ``colormap`` attribute can then be used
    alongside a colormapper to correctly apply the ascii palette to a certain output.

    A large number of the yaml files below were modified because we've renamed colormapper
    ``matplotlib_linear_norm`` to ``linear_norm`` instead. We did this because the original
    name was inaccurate, as that colormapper didn't just produce matplotlib-based colormaps.

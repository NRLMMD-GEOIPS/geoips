enhancement:
- title: 'New Module-based Validators Interface'
  description: |
    This update creates an entirely new module-based 'validators' interface. Plugins of
    this type should be responsible for producing statistics via the comparison of a
    produced dataset and a source of truth dataset that can be displayed via a specific
    output formatter. Think of a bar chart, regression analysis, etc.

    This update sets up the basic infrastructure of the validators interface, adds this
    interface to relevant CLI commands, and creates a dummy validator plugin that can
    be used for testing purposes.

- title: CLI Unit Tests -- Test Dataset Name Updates
  description: |
    We have unit tests for every GeoIPS CLI command and the test module for 'geoips list
    test-datasets' needs updated. This is a simple update to the hardcoded values for
    our test datasets. No logic was modified, just the hardcoded values.

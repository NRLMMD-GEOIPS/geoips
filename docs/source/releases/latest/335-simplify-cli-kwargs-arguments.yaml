enhancement:
- title: 'Add support for invalid JSON in command-line kwargs. eg. --reader-kwargs'
  description: |
    'JSON does not officially support single quotes ( eg. '' ). However, sometimes people include them in command line kwargs. This adds support for single quotes by calling ast.literal_eval instead of json.loads.'

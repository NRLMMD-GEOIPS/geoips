bug fix:
- title: 'Ignore dot files and directories from plugin registry'
  description: |
    As we encountered in our annual 2025 GeoIPS tutorial, we realized that 'plugins'
    found in either '.' (dot) directories or files were included in the plugin registry.
    Since these files are obfuscated from the user and in almost any situtation are not
    'true' plugins, we should omit any instance of these plugins from the plugin
    registry. This PR adds logic to do just that.

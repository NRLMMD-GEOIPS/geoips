Regression Fix:
- description: |
    With the addition of Command Class Factories, Shared Arguments, and Aliases, we had
    an expected regression that would impact the functionality of the command
    'geoips tree'. While we still may make updates to this command in the future,
    regarding its output and how we'd like to unit test it, we now have working in a
    much cleaner fashion. This PR addressed removing duplicate entries in the output
    of the tree, as well hardcoded some conditionals for corner cases that would cause
    duplicate entries do to the structure of aliases. For example, we had to add
    conditionals when we encountered 'sector' as a command name, as this is an alias for
    'geoips list sectors' and 'geoips describe sectors', and is the actual command name
    of 'geoips test sector'.

    Additionally, we commented out the functionality of 'hyperlinking' the text as the
    current documentation is not being built up on GitHub and renders that functionality
    useless at the moment. In the future, we expect to bring the hyperlink functionality
    back in and update how we retrieve the command name as we change how 'prog' is set
    for each commands' subparser attribute.

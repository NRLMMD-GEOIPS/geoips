bug fix:
- description: |
    Add a step in the ``build_sphinx_html`` CI job to install the package for which we
    want to build documentation prior to building the documentation. Also remove the
    installation code from the ``build_docs.sh`` script.

    This fixes an issue where installation doesn't always happen correctly causing the
    docs to fail to build.

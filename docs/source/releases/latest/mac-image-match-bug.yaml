bug fix:
  - description: |
      While testing Mac for the 2024 tutorial, it was found quite a few tests were
      failing due to bad image comparisons. Upon greater inspection, it was found that
      these tests were failing only due to a couple of different pixels, which we assume
      is due to different backend mechanics depending on your OS. Instead of failing a
      test if a single pixel is outside of a certain threshold, we've decided to test an
      image's match with another pixel via a group basis.

      Ie. If num_pixels_mismatched_by_threshold / total_num_pixels > x%, then we'll
      raise an error. This is a more lenient test, but will still catch differences
      between two images. All in all, we wan't to ignore tiny differences between images
      and catch the more glaring differences that affect lots of pixels when they occur.

enhancement:
- title: 'CLI Test Dataset Update'
  description: |
    Consolidates hardcoded test dataset urls to one location and updates how the CLI
    accesses this information for the command 'geops list test-datasets'. Additionally,
    updates the command 'geoips config install' by providing and optional flag
    (-o, --outdir), which overwrites the default install location if provided.

    Additionally, this PR updated ami_netcdf.py reader. Dynamic calculation of
    geolocation variables seems inconsistent and caused problems with GeoColor products.
    The reader now uses hardcoded values for geolocation to make sure products are
    consistent.

    This PR is related to a GeoColor PR which updates its installation instructions.

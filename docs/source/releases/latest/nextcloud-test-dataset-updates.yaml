  description: |
    With the recent release of brand new and/or updated test datasets coming from
    internal NRL, we needed to update our public hosting of datasets to match these
    changes. The data has since been transferred over, and we need to reflect this
    within our code base so the CLI can properly install the new datasets. This was a
    simple update to test-data-urls.yaml, based on a script I wrote to detect unique
    test datasets being used within plugin packages.

    Additionally, this PR fixes a small bug in the 'geoips config install' command where
    'all' wasn't working properly.

    Finally, this PR added test datasets for saphir and cygnss. When calling the test
    scripts for these datasets, it was found that cygnss' compare image was out of date
    and needed updating.

    *From GEOIPS#647: 2024-06-19, Automating ``create_plugin_registries``*

    The command 'create_plugin_registries' has greatly improved the time it takes to
    operate GeoIPS under the hood. This is because all plugins are no longer loaded into
    memory, as we can now traverse a plugin registry to load the exact plugins we need
    to, when we need them. Unfortuneately, this requires the user to run
    'create_plugin_registries' anytime a new plugin has been added to one or more plugin
    packages. We've been thinking for a long time of how to automate this process, and
    this update does just that.

    'create_plugin_registries' can now either be ran manually, or will attempt to be
    done automatically by GeoIPS when a plugin is requested. It will be done
    automatically if a user calls 'get_plugin' using the 'rebuild_registries=True'
    keyword argument. If a user has no registries in any of their plugin packages, then
    this is ran the first time get_plugin is called when certain attributes of the
    associated interface are being initialized.

    If the registries already exist, but a plugin is missing or seemingly out of sync,
    then 'create_plugin_registries' will be ran, and get_plugin will be called again. If
    the failure persists, then it is likely a problem on the user's end that they need
    to fix before running GeoIPS. Now, users no longer have to run
    'create_plugin_registries', unless they choose to do so manually.

- title: 'Add pytest-based integration tests for all packages'
  description: |
    * Remove individual package repopaths and pkgnames from geoips test_integration,
      since integration tests are now called directly from each package.
    * Allow "integration" marker for interactive_pytest.sh (to run all integration
      tests)
    * Remove individual test calls to individual repositories integration tests, since
      they are now tested directly.
    * Add "preprocess" marker to pytest.ini

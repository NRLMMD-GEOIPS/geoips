bug fix:
- description: |
    This PR fixed small bugs and formatting inconsistencies with the CLI. Specifically,
    this PR addressed the format of the output of 'geoips describe' commands, to make
    the keys in the yaml output all be in title format rather than (some_val:) vs.
    (Some Val:). In this PR we were working on getting CLI documentation up to date,
    and discovered a bug with 'geoips list packages' where the '--columns' flag was not
    actually working. This was a simple fix and that functionality is now working as
    expected. Unit tests have been updated to address these changes.

    This PR updated the CLI documentation to reflect the current state of the CLI code.
    Largely, this PR went through the documentation of the CLI commands and made sure
    that what was documented matched what would actually happen when that command was
    ran. There was a duplicate entry in the documentation that was removed as well.

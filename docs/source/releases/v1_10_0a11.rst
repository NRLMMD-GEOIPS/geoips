Breaking Changes
================

Update static sector loads to work with new YAML format
-------------------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#202: 2023-04-30, update sector loads*

Load pyresample area def directly by specifying load_area(filename, "spec")
Then explicitly add in "sector_info" (metadata), and "sector_type" (family)
fields to the resulting area_def.

bug fix:
- title: 'Provide empty line and sample index definitions for full disk reads'
  description: |
    Radiance retrievals pass in line and sample indices even when retrieving
    the full disk, but those variables were only defined for non-full disk
    reads. Defining full disk versions as empty lists so that radiance
    retrieval succeeds.

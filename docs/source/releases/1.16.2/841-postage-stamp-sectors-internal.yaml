- title: 'Add small sectors to use in integration tests'
  description: |
    To make integration tests more efficient, create a standard set of test sectors that can be used for
    specific integration test cases. This will include
    
    * general full disk test sectors (not dependent on dataset)

      * By convention, all full disk sectors cover the full spatial extent of a geostationary satellite, with varying height/width as needed (825x800 is a good size to start, resulting in approximately 20km resolution)
    * general tiny subsector (not dependent on dataset)

      * By convention, all tiny subsectors are 300x300, with varying resolution as needed (3km is a good size to start)
    * tiny sectors with specific meteorological / time of day features (tied to specific test dataset)

      * All sectors must include some clouds, some clear sky, some land, and some ocean
      * edge of scan
      * daytime
      * nighttime
      * terminator
      * nadir
      * daytime edge of scan
      * nighttime edge of scan

    Additionally, add a test script to facilitate producing Google-Earthable geotiff outputs for better
    evaluation of test sector contents.

    Updated test scripts to include tiny sectors.

    Notes on plugin names

    * Plugin names are of the format

      * test_<satellite>_<proj>_<res>_<OPTIONAL:edge|nadir>_<day|night|terminator>_<OPTIONAL:tc|ar|volc>_<YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ>.yaml
      * E.g., test_goes16_eqc_3km_edge_day_tc_20200918T1950Z
    * Parsing sector names is not required, so optional field is fine to include only as needed within the file name.
    * If we require tracking / using the metadata included in the plugin names, we will add explicit metadata to the plugins themselves that can be used for sorting / searching the available test plugins
    * If we want to sort differently than the hard coded plugin name order, we will additionally implement sorting within the CLI based on the plugin metadata (we just picked a reasonable order for reasonable sorting)
    * Filenames for individual test sector plugins do NOT have to match the plugin names (to avoid excessively long filenames on disk)
    * For now, must manually update area_id and name to match exactly, and must manually update both description and docstring to match exactly.  Eventually plugins will be set up to automatically populate area_id and description if they are not set (name and docstring are required), but for now must copy/paste.

  description: |
    If the GEOIPS_TEST_DATA_REMOVE_TGZ env var is set to True, then remove the tgz
    file after successfully extracting the tgz file.  Also add the --skip-old-files

- title: 'Add site, system, and all options to interactive_pytest.sh, and --tg=short'
  description: |
    Allow calling interactive_pytest.sh with common options for geoips-site,
    geoips-system, or all.

    Also add --tb=short for more useful output.

    Also default to putting logs in $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS/logs/pytests/interactive_pytest,
    since we now write pytest test_integration.py logs to pytests/integration.

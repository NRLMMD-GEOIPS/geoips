- title: 'Add call cmd function to geoips_utils.py, call from pytest-based integration tests'
  description: |
    This is useful for shell-script based installation commands, as well as pytest-
    based integration testing.  Produces log friendly subprocess command output,
    with options to redirect to a log with a non-blocking pipe (to allow writing
    to the log file before an entire process is complete), or just printing to stdout/
    stderr.

    Updated pytest-based integration test to use call_cmd, and redirect to logs that
    live in $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS/logs/pytests/integration.

    Also added option to pipe to tee or not redirect to a file at all in
    check_system_requirements.sh run_command.

    Also default to not including prefixes (stdout/stderr/> ) for pipe, since pipe
    returns clean output.

bug fix:
- title: 'Allow overriding GEOIPS_CONDA_INSTALL_DIR upstream, and ALWAYS set/use GEOIPS_CONDA_INSTALL_DIR'
  description: |
    If GEOIPS_CONDA_INSTALL_DIR is set, ensure it is used in both config_geoips and
    geoips_conda_init_setup. 

    Also, ensure GEOIPS_CONDA_INSTALL_DIR is always set, so we can consistently use the
    correct installation location, without hardcoding $GEOIPS_DEPENDENCIES_DIR/miniconda3
    all over the place.

bug fix:
- title: 'Print out full path to final output files in addition to env var replaced paths'
  description: |
    For easier CTRL-Click in VSCode, include both full path and env var replaced paths.
    env var replaced paths are good for copy/paste generalized outputs.

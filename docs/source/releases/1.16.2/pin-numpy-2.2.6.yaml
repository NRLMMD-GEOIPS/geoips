bug fix:
- title: 'Pin numpy to < 2.3'
  description: |
    numpy 2.3 changes how numpy handles scalar types so they no longer inherit directly
    from Python's built in types.  This prevents packages like PyYAML from automatically
    treating them as serializable. In the past, isinstance(float, np.float64(1)) would
    have returned True. Now it returns False. So, YAML serialization of numpy types no
    longer works. We have to convert prior to serialization.

    For now, we are going to pin numpy to < 2.3 while we resolve these updates.

    Additionally add gxx_linux-64 to conda install for consistent glibc version for
    installing numpy >= 2.3, and numexpr >= 2.11.

    Additionally, add libgit2 to conda install for consistent libgit2 for
    pygit / brassy installation.

bug fix:
- title: 'Name cached zarr/memmap files as partial when being created'
  description: |
    Need to assign cache filenames a temporary name when being generated in order to
    prevent any concurrent geoips calls from reading in an incomplete cache. Cache files
    that are in the process of being generated have ".partial" appended to the end of
    the cached filename. If a concurrent geoips procflow finds a "partial" cache file,
    the procflow will check for a specified period (30 seconds by default) to see if the
    partial cache is replaced with the final and complete cache. If the partial cache is
    not replaced in this time frame, the procflow will raise a custom
    CacheNotFoundError.

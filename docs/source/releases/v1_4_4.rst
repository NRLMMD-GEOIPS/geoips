Version 1.4.4 (2022-03-06)
**************************

v1.4.4: 2022-03-06, command line override, unsectored product, product database support; Visible product corrections

Test Repo Updates
=================

Update ABI Visible Products with more informative colorbar label
----------------------------------------------------------------

    * Include channel and wavelength in colorbar label
    * ABI static and TC Visible test png outputs

Breaking Interface Changes
==========================

single_channel algorithm - rename solar zenith angle specifications
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* See "Bug fixes"

Improvements
============

Product tuning updates
----------------------

* Add "update\_output\_dict\_from\_command\_line\_args" to support command line modifications to YAML output config

    * filename\_format\_kwargs
    * metadata\_filename\_format\_kwargs

* Add "produce\_current\_time" function in output\_config interface

    * Support "produce\_times" field in output config to filter required times for processing

* Add "Uncorrected-Channel" product, that just plots normalized data directly (using min/max of data itself)
* Update colorbar labels for ABI, AHI, SEVIRI, MODIS, and VIIRS Visible imagery to include the channel used in the plot
* dev/product.py get\_product: Loop through dictionary elements in product\_inputs, only replacing what exists.

    * To allow specifying only specific elements within one of the product parameters dictionaries
        from within product\_inputs specifications, if one of the dictionary elements is a dictionary
        itself, loop through that, replacing with the updated values found in product\_inputs.
    * This allows maintaining all the defaults, and only specifying things that must change.

* Add "numpy\_arrays\_nan" coverage check interface module (for non-masked-arrays)

TC YAML Template Updates
------------------------

* Add tc\_visir\_3200km YAML gridlines parameters file - identical to tc\_visir, but 5 degree grid spacing.
* Created 1400x1400, 1024x1024, 256x256, 512x512, 800x800, and 1600x1600 subdirectories for tc templates.

    * 2km and 4km 1600x1600 TC template YAMLs
    * 4km 256x256

* Will NOT change tc\_web\_template.yaml, etc, since ALL test scripts use those.
* Perhaps explicitly setting these values in the YAML configs would be better than having
    completely separate files for each shape/resolution - will address direct YAML output
    config modifications at a later date - likely would be a method for overriding fields of
    TC template yamls, plotting\_params YAMLs, as well as product params YAMLs (so you could still use
    completely separate individual files, but also override individual fields within as needed).

Sectoring / Processing Order
----------------------------

    * Add "resector=False" get\_alg\_xarray option to config\_based

        * this enables alg\_interp\_cmap and alg\_cmap product types (no pre-interpolation).
        * Currently "self\_register" and "reader\_defined" area\_def types lead to "resector=False" for get\_alg\_xarray.

            * Skip ALL sectoring for reader\_defined and self\_register.

    * Add xarray\_to\_numpy alg type support to get\_alg\_xarray

        * for alg\_interp\_cmap and alg\_cmap product types

            * no pre-interpolation - must pass sectored xarray, so can only include a single dataset

Product database support
------------------------

* Added product database command line argument
* Added hooks to single\_source and config\_based procflows

    * Checks if database environment variables are set
    * Uses yaml metadata file to populate the database
    * Prints "DATABASESUCCESS" for all products written to the database

Installation / Setup / Logging Process
--------------------------------------

* Separate vim8 installation and vim8 plugin setup in base\_install\_and\_test.sh
* Remove verbose log statements including entire command line arguments

    * lots and lots of filenames, and now the command line call is printed on multiple lines separately

Bug fixes
=========

Resolve issues with Visible products
------------------------------------

* Update AHI Visible parameters (was washed out / saturated)

    * gamma\_list: []
    * data\_range: [0.0, 120.0]
    * scalefactor still 100

* Update MODIS Visible parameters (was all white)

    * gamma\_list: []
    * scale\_factor: 1.0 (comes out of the reader 0 to 100!)

* Update Visible product

    * min\_day\_zen -> max\_day\_zen for single\_channel algorithm
    * Add comments that AHI and MODIS override standard parameters for Visible

* SEVIRI reader reflectance calculations

    * reinstate: ref[rad > 0] = np.pi * rad[rad > 0] / irrad

        * Previously included solar zenith correction, so I had removed the entire line

    * Add log statements with min/max data values for reference

single_channel algorithm - rename solar zenith angle specifications
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* rename min\_day\_zen -> max\_day\_zen

    * since day is 0-90, we want to identify the max zenith angle that will still be considered daytime

* rename max\_night\_zen -> min\_night\_zen

    * night is 90-180, identify minimum zenith angle that will still be night

* Updated Visible product with new names

Error Checking
--------------

* Added check in overpass\_predictor.py if sun.rise\_time exists
* Added handling in amsub\_mirs reader for if there are bad ScanTime values

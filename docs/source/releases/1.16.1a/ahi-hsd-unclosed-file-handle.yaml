- title: 'Fix ahi_hsd warnings'
  description: |
    Simple PR which addresses warnings raised via the ahi_hsd reader. The changes made
    in this PR address an unclosed file handler and multiple instances where
    n-dimensional arrays were cast to a scalar value, which will be deprecated in the
    future. No functional changes were made.

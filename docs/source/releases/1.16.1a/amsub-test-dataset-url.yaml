- title: 'Added test_data_amsub to nextcloud'
  description: |
    This PR is part of many updates we've made to public test datasets for GeoIPS. We
    found matching AMSU-B data to what was used internally, and are now making it public
    so we can expand our test suite.

    Additionally, this PR removed a duplicate test-data-urls.yaml file from setup/,
    which was used before dev-staging got merged into main. test-data-urls.yaml is now
    located in geoips/commandline/ancillary_info/, and should work whether or not the
    user is installed in editable mode.

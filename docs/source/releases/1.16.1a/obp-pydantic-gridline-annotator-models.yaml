enhancement:
- title: 'Pydantic Gridline Annotator Plugin Models'
  description: |
    Transformed legacy json schema code for gridline annotators into our newly developed
    pydantic schema. Currently still support legacy schema validation for operational
    GeoIPS, however these changes are one of many needed to support the order based
    procflow.

    Additionally, this PR modified unit testing code for sectors and feature annotators
    in an attempt to generalize the testing that will be applied to these models. Added
    a test cases file for gridline annotators models as well, used for unit testing.

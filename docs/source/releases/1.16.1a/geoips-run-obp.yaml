enhancement:
- title: 'GeoIPS Run Order Based Command'
  description: |
    This update adds a new command, ``geoips run order_based`` command, which executes
    the order based process workflow (procflow). While there will likely be updates to
    this command in the future, these changes allow you to execute an obp procflow from
    the command line rather than manually calling the associated python module.

    Currently, the order based procflow only supports reader plugins. More to be
    supported in the future.

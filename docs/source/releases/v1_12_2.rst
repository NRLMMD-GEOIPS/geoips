Bug fixes
=========

Rename Geokompsat source name to AMI
------------------------------------

Rename the source name "geokompsat" to "ami" to match convention.

::

    renamed: geoips/plugins/modules/readers/geokompsat_netcdf.py -> geoips/plugins/modules/readers/ami_netcdf.py
    renamed: geoips/plugins/yaml_files/geokompsat_netcdf.yaml -> geoips/plugins/yaml_files/ami_netcdf.yaml
    modified: geoips/plugins/modules/readers/ami_netcdf.py
    modified: geoips/plugins/yaml_files/ami_netcdf.yaml

Remove GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR from check_code.sh
---------------------------------------------

Set path to geoips test scripts relative to the current $0 - this allows
running check_code.sh without GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR being set.

::

  modified: tests/utils/check_code.sh

Update github actions workflows to ensure proper dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------

Add "test" dependency to build-html-docs and build-pdf-docs - was failing when
attempting to import datatree.DataTree, since that is only installed with the
"test" dependencies.

Add GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR to pytest-short, since an interactive log unit test
relies on an ABI test dataset. I am still uncertain whether we want pytest-short
to rely on test data, but since this is a test dataset that is used in the
base_install and base_test, we will allow it.

Do not wrap on hyphen for log_with_emphasis outputs
---------------------------------------------------

Can't CTRL-click on imagery in output if it is wrapped!  Ensure output filenames
containing hyphens do not get wrapped.

::

  modified: geoips/commandline/log_setup.py

Remove check to only vstack mask array for BT_CHANNELS
------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#493: 2024-04-24, version update*

During the updates adding geolocation resampling to the VIIRS reader, a check
was put in requiring the variable to be in BT_CHANNELS before vstacking the
mask array.  This caused the viirs unprojected image test to fail due to incompatible
shapes. Remove that check - need to determine if it is actually required...

::

        modified:   geoips/plugins/modules/readers/viirs_netcdf.py

Import from test_plugin_registries for test_interfaces command
--------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#493: 2024-04-24, version update*

Update test_interfaces for:

1. Import PluginRegistryError from errors vs plugin_registry
2. Import validate_all_plugins from test_plugin_registries  vs plugin_registries

Additionally, move test_interfaces out of the geoips package, since
it uses pytest utilities so does not function without a complete
clone of the repository.  Since test_interfaces.py only functions
with the test infrastructure in place (via pip install -e),
move it to geoips/tests/utils/test_interfaces.py, and update the call
in check_code.sh.

::

  modified: geoips/commandline/test_interfaces.py
  modified: pyproject.toml
  modified: tests/utils/check_code.sh
  renamed: geoips/commandline/test_interfaces.py -> tests/utils/test_interfaces.py

Rethink implementation of Plugin Registry Validation
----------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#526: 2024-04-29, Move test_interfaces out of geoips/commandline and into tests directory*

This stems from *GEOIPS#442: 2024-04-16, Move PyTest functionality from PluginRegistry Class to Unit Tests*,
which moved all pytest-dependent functions of the PluginRegistry class to a separate
unit test. We missed a reference to this validation in
``geoips/commandline/test_interfaces.py`` which ended up failing due to the moved
functions. We now invoke the ``import_optional_dependencies`` function in
``geoips/context_managers.py`` to implement this validation, and if the user does not
have pytest installed, we just don't validate the PluginRegistry and continue to
interface testing. We probably should discuss this a bit more, to see if we want to
refactor the unit tests to not use pytest for validation, or if it is fine leaving it
as-is.

Revert ABI Visible static and AHI WV GEOTIFF images back to original
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Somehow these had VERY minor changes (9 pixel difference, non-recognizable with
the naked eye).  Just reverting back to the originals that were in dev, and will
address if necessary when pushed back out.  There was no record of if/when these
changed, so going to just revert.

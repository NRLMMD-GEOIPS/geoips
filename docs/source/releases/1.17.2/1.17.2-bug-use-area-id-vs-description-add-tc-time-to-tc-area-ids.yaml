bug fix:
  - title: Use area_def.area_id rather than description as the unique identifier
    description: |
      Description is not guaranteed to be unique between sectors (it is not validated
      in any way), but area_id is expected to match the sector plugin name, which
      explicitly must be unique. Also, descriptions can be very long and unwieldy (many
      lines) when used as an identifier in logs... area_id is more appropriate.

      Update all instances of area_def.description to area_def.area_id.

      Additionally, this required the below update to include the synoptic time in the
      TC area ids, to ensure uniqueness, and using the storm_id in the sector_info
      for filtering command line requested TC sector list (so we do not have to include
      a specific time in the command line sector list request, but just the storm ID
      and geoips will find the closest time).

  - title: Include synoptic time in TC area_def area_ids, and filter sector list based on parsed storm_id
    description: |
      Update the TC area defs to include the synoptic time in the area_id,
      to ensure uniqueness for each storm location (since they are each unique sectors),
      and update the tc sector_list filtering to use the sector_info storm_id rather than
      the area_def.area_id when determining which sectors to process, allowing us to
      only request the storm id command line and allow geoips to determine the appropriate
      time programmatically.

      This required adding the storm_id field to the bdeck_parser to ensure the
      geoips-style storm id is included in the output fields.

      There is also one test output that uses metadata_tc vs metadata_default.  Update
      sar nrcs test output metadata YAML with new storm_id field, since metadata_tc
      includes ALL sector_info fields in the output (metadata_default includes only
      a specific list of fields, new fields are not included, to avoid unnecessary
      updates to test outputs).

      So the text_winds_tc_fname filenames do not change, update to use storm_id rather
      than area_id.

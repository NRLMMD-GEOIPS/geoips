  - title: Rename tiny sector products
    description: |
      Just channel based, not Infrared. Had to update all the tiny sector test outputs,
      update the tiny sector pytest script for variable names, as well as update the
      product names in the integration test product YAMLs.

      Additionally, the tiny_sectors_geostationary.sh script required an update ONLY to
      the comment identifying a possible product_name.  Added detailed usage and
      explanation of the tiny_sectors_geostationary.sh script while I was at it.

    description: |
      Now we can call pytest -m tiny_sector_global_example and it will run them all,
      so just specify explicitly in the test_tiny_sectors_geoips.py script.

      Also add comments to the test script and procflow config and pytest script
      explaining what it is for

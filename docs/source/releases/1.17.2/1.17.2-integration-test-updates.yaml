bug fix:
  - title: "Allow interactive pytest to make better use of defaults in pytest.ini"
    description: |
      * cd to directory when running pytest, do NOT pass path (otherwise,
        it does not limit itself to unit_tests and integration_tests directories)
      * Pass "$@" directly to pytest call, so arguments are preserved.
      * Remove args and geoips-system commands, just use all.
      * Add -k as well as -m default args for individual commands, to allow filtering
        with both -k and -m for short, long, required, optional, etc.

  - title: "Separate build_docs and check_code into a lint pytest marker"
    description: |
      Still include build_docs and check_code in integration pytest marker, but add
      a new 'lint' pytest marker for calling linting directly.

  - title: "For test output consistency, unset all WWW output location env vars from test_integration.py setup_environment"
    description: |
      For consistency in tests, ensure the output env vars are not set by default in the
      geoips test_integration.py setup_environment. Add argument to setup_environment
      requesting the WWW env vars should NOT be unset.  This ensures consistent
      testing by default, but allows you to explicitly test specific output locations
      if needed.

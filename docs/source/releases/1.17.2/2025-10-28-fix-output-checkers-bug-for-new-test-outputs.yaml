bug fix:
- title: 'Do not attempt to list output comparison directory if it does not exist.'
  description: |
    This was preventing new test scripts from running with a comparison path
    that did not already have an existing output directory.  Update so log is
    printed noting that the output directory does not exist if it does not yet
    exist, else list the directory.

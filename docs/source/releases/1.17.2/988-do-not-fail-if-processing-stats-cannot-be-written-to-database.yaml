bug fix:
  - title: "Do not fail if processing stats cannot be written to database"
    description: |
      Sometimes the METADATA key from xobjs is dropped during processing, which causes
      the procflow to fail at the very end when writing processing statistics to the
      database. We should properly fix this, but for now catch the error and log as an
      error rather than failing.

enhancement:
  - title: Add x_size and y_size kwargs to imagery_annotated output formatter.
    description: |
      Allows specifying x_size and y_size separately from the area definition shape.
      This is useful if you are producing multiple output formats for a single sector,
      and you do not need as high resolution output for the annotated image as other
      potential outputs.  This prevents reprocessing the data for multiple sized sectors,
      but still allows outputting a lower resolution / smaller annotated image.

      This reduced the time to write an 8250x8000 sector from 42s for the full size
      to 20s for 515x500, plus MUCH less space on disk.

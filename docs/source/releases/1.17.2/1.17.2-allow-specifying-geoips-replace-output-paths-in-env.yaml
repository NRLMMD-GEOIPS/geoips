- title: Allow specifying GEOIPS_REPLACE_OUTPUT_PATHS in the environment
  description: |
    To allow specifying different environment variables for output path replacement,
    allow an environment variable override in geoips/filenames/base_paths.py allowing
    passing in other than the default TCWWW, PUBLICWWW, TCPRIVATEWWW, PRIVATEWWW env
    vars.

    * Add GEOIPS_REPLACE_OUTPUT_PATHS to filenames/base_paths.py. It should be a space
      delimited list of env vars WITHOUT \$ in env var, with the \$ added in the split
      list in geoips.
    * Loop through GEOIPS_REPLACE_OUTPUT_PATHS in geoips_utils for replacing variables,
      rather than explicit list of env vars. Note we still must loop through the
      standard non-output-path env vars explicitly (GEOIPS_OUTDIRS, GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR,
      etc), since these are env vars that are needed/used for other thigns, not
      just the output paths.
    * Do NOT setup_environment from the full_setup, etc fixtures, call setup environment
      from each individual test script function with markers.  This allows individual
      groups of tests to request NOT unsetting the env vars found in GEOIPS_REPLACE_OUTPUT_PATHS,
      by passing in the requested argument.
    * Add unset_output_path_env_var argument to test_integration.py, unsetting the
      output path env vars for consistency by default, but allowing maintaining them
      if we need to test the output env vars themselves.
    * Loop through GEOIPS_REPLCE_OUTPUT_PATHS in check_output_file_list rather than
      hard coded list.
    * Don't include all REALTIME_OUTPUT_ARGS options in interactive_pytest.sh (since
      we include them in the realtime tests), just note that it defaults to writing
      output file list to temp location, comparing output, and copying output files.
    * Also remove apparently unsupported arguments to geoips_utils... This would have
      provided unexpected results (ie, asking for specific variables to replace,
      then not actually replacing them), so removing to make sure it breaks catastrophically
      if it was attempted to be used somewhere, so we can re-add and fix so it works.
      But perhaps it is not needed (just use the GEOIPS_REPLACE_OUTPUT_PATHS)
    * Also, remove create registries call from calls to full_install, etc from the
      integration tests (takes MUCH longer to start up the pytests with the create
      registries).

bug fixes:
  - title: Correct logs for pre-sectoring data in config-based procflow.
    description: |
      Previously the logs identified the pre-sectoring option within config-based
      procflow as "SELF REGISTERED". Update logs to include a log statement for cases
      of no pre-sectoring, as well as updating the pre-sectoring logs to indicate
      SECTOR AREA_DEF rather than SECTOR SELF REGISTER (since self registering actually
      uses NO pre-sectoring).

      No actual change to the logic, just clarifying the log outputs and simplifying
      the conditional.

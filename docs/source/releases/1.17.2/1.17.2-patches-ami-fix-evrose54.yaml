bug fix:
- title: '1.17.2 ami_netcdf bug fix patch'
  description: |
    The 1.17.2 release introduced a small bug which made the
    tests/unit_tests_long/plugins/modules/readers/test_readers.py ami_netcdf reader test
    fail. This was caused by the new implementation of satellite zenith angle masking.
    Reverting to the previous mechanics solved this. This still supports dynamic
    satzen masking which the new release implemented. Also, updated the 'get_test_files'
    function to use the new test_data_ami dataset rather than the ami data found in the
    test_data_noaa_aws dataset. The data is the exact same.

    Additionally, added registered_plugins.yaml to the .gitignore.

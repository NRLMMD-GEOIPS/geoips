Bug fixes
=========

Update variable names for alt_varname in coverage checkers
----------------------------------------------------------

The keyword argument name was changed from alt_varname_for_covg to alt_varname,
but the actual variable names within the functions were not changed.

Updating to match.  I would like to update this to something more reasonable,
but I haven't decided what that is yet.

Enhancements
============

Add more informative exception messages to interface PluginErrors
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ensure developer can immediately identify the plugin, package, and module
related to a PluginError or ValidationError message.

::

  modified:   geoips/interfaces/base.py
  modified:   geoips/geoips_utils.py

Add interpolator product family schema
--------------------------------------

Was not initially created

::

  new: schema/products/interpolator.yaml
  new: schema/product_defaults/interpolator.yaml
  new: schema/product_defaults/specs/interpolator.yaml

Refactoring Updates
===================

Update setuptools_scm to write to _version.py vs version.py
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a more accepted and standard usage. Ensure we ignore the _version.py
file, import from __init__.py, as well as adding to pyproject.toml.

::

  .gitignore
  geoips/__init__.py
  pyproject.toml

Testing Updates
===============

Add full image paths to log output on bad compare
-------------------------------------------------

Add diff image, current image, and "correct" image paths to log output on bad compare.
Makes for easy viewing of outputs.

::

  compare_outputs.py

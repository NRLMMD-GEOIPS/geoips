bug fix:
- title: 'Add TCPRIVATEWWW to both geoips_utils and base_paths'
  description: |
    Ensure TCPRIVATEWWW is a supported env var for WWW output locations.  This should
    complete the available standard WWW output locations, no others will be
    supported as a standard across the GeoIPS Ecosystem.

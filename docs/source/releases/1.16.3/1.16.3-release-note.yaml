- title: build docs updates for template_basic_plugin deploy pages.
  description: |
    * build_docs.sh Must write to repopath, not $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/pkgname. The
      build works either way, but deploy_pages.sh does not find the html to push
      if it is not in the repopath. Output location does not matter otherwise.

- title: build docs bug fix for broken links on main documentation index.html
  description: |
    * index.template.rst api link should be PKGNAME_api, not just api. The main link
      to the api was broken in all documentation builds (geoips, template_basic_plugin,
      and all other plugin package documentation).  The link at the top to the
      api was correct, just not the main link in the center of the default page.
    * Note the required pages are getting-started/index.html, PKGNAME_api/index.html,
      and releases/index.html, based on the hard coded links in index.rst.html. 
      getting-started is currently NOT listed under a required section in docs-sections,
      but we will leave it that way for now since, while it does result in a broken
      link in the documentation if it is not included, if we move it to the required
      section it will break ALL plugin repo doc builds until we add
      getting-started/index.rst to every plugin repo (currently NO plugin repos have
      getting-started/index.rst, only PKGNAME_api and releases). We will want to
      be entirely sure we have landed on the desired required documentation layout
      for all plugin repos before updating the docs structure for all repos.

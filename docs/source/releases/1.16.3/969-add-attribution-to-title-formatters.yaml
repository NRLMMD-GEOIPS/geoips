enhancement:
- title: 'Add support for dataset attribution in xarray object metadata, YAML metadata output, and imagery titles'
  description: |
    Per data provider request, ensure we can consistently and programmatically provide
    appropriate dataset attribution in backend xarray objects as well as final
    product outputs (imagery, YAML metadata, etc).

    * hy2 script - Update output to remove NRL and note source data from EUMETSAT
    * xarray-standards - Add new attribution xarray attrs, and ensure all existing geoips_utils attrs are included in the list.
    * geoips_utils - Add new attribution xarray attrs to copy_standard_metadata, and reorder so it's the same order as xarray-standards
    * mpl_utils - DO NOT set title_copyright to gpaths GEOIPS_COPYRIGHT in mpl_utils, ensure it is set
      in individual title_formatter plugins for better control within the title_formatters.
    * metadata_tc output formatter - add xarray_obj attribution fields (data_provider and
      data_attribution) to the sector_info dictionary, which automatically gets included
      in the YAML metadata output.
    * sar_winds_netcdf - add CSA (rcm/radarsat) and ESA (sentinel) and NOAA STAR attribution appropriately to SAR
      netcdf readers (which is used in the output formatters and title formatters)
    * hy2 image output - just slightly changed the title, based on updates to the test script
    * hy2 test script - Remove NRL Imagery from title_copyright (since now included in line 1 by default),
      and note 'Source data' copyright EUMETSAT, since no longer explicitly stating imagery is copyright NRL.
    * sar image output - Added attribution lines to title (no change to first 2 lines)
    * sar yaml output and test script - update to full metadata_tc YAML output format - which includes
      additional fields beyond the metadata_standard output format. Previously was not
      including metadata_tc in test outputs to avoid having to update test outputs all
      the time if we slightly modified our desired TC metadata output fields, but including
      a single test to minimize output updates for changes to metadata_tc, but still provide
      consistent testing of that metadata output formatter.

      * covg_info (fname, full, and image_production)
      * start, mid, and end data_times
      * NEW data_provider
      * NEW data_attribution (long, short, and title)
    * sar test script - use tc_copyright title formatter (to include new data_attribution
      information from reader / xarray attrs), also update to use metadata_tc rather than
      metadata_standard (so data_attribution is included in YAML output also).

    A couple random pytest updates thrown in

    * interactive_pytest - Add required and optional arguments to interactive_pytest.sh
    * pytest.ini - standard sync update
    * test_tiny_sectors_geoips - add tiny_sector, sample_output, and optional markers as appropriate.

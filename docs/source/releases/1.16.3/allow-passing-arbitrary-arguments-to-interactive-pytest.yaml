  - title: "Allow passing arbitrary arguments to interactive_pytest.sh"
    description: |
      interactive_pytest.sh started out only allowing specific commands that mapped
      to specific sets of pytest arguments.  Allow a few specific commands, but also
      a command that allows passing arbitrary arguments to pytest, but retaining
      the individual logfile redirection for integration tests, and the base
      integration test arguments.

      Supported interactive pytest commands as follows

      * args - pass arbitrary pytest arguments in after the repopath
      * geoips-site - test all installed plugins, minus the system implementation-based tests
      * geoips-system - run everything possible (unit tests and integration tests, site and system implementations)
      * all - alias for geoips-system
      * full-single-repo - exclude 'spans_multiple_packages' to ensure the same test will not fail in multiple repositories
      * short - 'short' unit tests only
      * long - 'long' running unit tests only

      To run specific integration test markers, just call with 'args' and pass in the
      desired arguments to pytest.

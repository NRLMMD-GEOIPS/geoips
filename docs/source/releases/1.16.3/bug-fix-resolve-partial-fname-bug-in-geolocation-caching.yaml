bug fixes:
- title: 'Ensure we write to fname_partial before moving it to fname'
  description: |
    memmap geolocation caching was initially updated correctly to
    write to fname_partial, then move fname_partial to fname, but
    zarr was still writing to fname.  Update all instances of
    partial geolocation cache files to write to the partial
    geolocation cache filename initially, then move the partial
    file to the final fname.

bug fix:
- title: 'Add standard non-dataset-specific tiny sectors for goes_east and goes_west'
  description: |
    There are 2 types of tiny sectors - dataset-specific and satellite-specific.  The
    satellite specific tiny sectors do not depend on a specific dataset, so should
    be named generically (not specifically goes16, goes18, etc), and should only be
    defined once (do not redefine the satellite-specific tiny sectors in plugin repos).

    General tiny sectors include

    * test_satellite_eqc_3km_landocean.yaml (was _subsector, renamed _landocean to be more specific)
    * test_satellite_eqc_3km_nadir.yaml (can be same as landocean, if nadir has land/ocean pixels)
    * test_satellite_longlat_50km_fulldisk.yaml

- title: 'Separate test_integration.py and test_tiny_sectors_geoips.py'
  description: |
    Since there are so many tiny sectors, separate them out into their own integration
    test script.

    I think we should have a separate tiny sector test script in every plugin repo
    that contains tiny sectors as well, so this will make it more clear how to
    organize / define the tiny sector tests in plugin repos.

    The tiny sector integration test script contains

    * OPTIONAL marker, no comparison to "correct" imagery

      * global_terminator_satzen.sh calls which spit out day, night, both products
        for each specific dataset, with null and 70 sat zen cutoff.  This is helpful
        for evaluating what data actually exists within a given dataset.
    * OPTIONAL marker, no comparison to correct imagery

      * geoips test sector --overlay commands for every tiny sector defined in the
        current repo, just spits out the overlay image output for each sector.

    * REQUIRED marker, comparison against correct imagery checked into the repo

      * tiny_sectors_geostationary.sh call for each tiny sector defined within the
        current repo.  This includes both non-dataset-specific test sectors, as
        well as dataset-specific test sectors.  Plugin repos should only have
        dataset-specific test sectors.

- title: 'Pass reponame into test_geostationary_sectors.sh so we can compare test outputs in the correct repo'
  description: |
    Previously hard coded to check test outputs in geoips/tests/outputs, update to
    pass in repo_name so we compare test outputs in repo_name/tests/outputs.

    Update test_integration.py to pass in geoips reponame, as well as test_geostationary_sectors.sh
    to use repo_name.

    Also replace asterisk in any log filename with - in interactive pytests.

- title: 'Add product-name-base argument to global_terminator_satzen script'
  description: |
    Pass product-name-base argument to global_terminator_satzen script, and use it
    to set an environment variable that is then used in the satzen.yaml procflow
    config to define the requested products for a given dataset.

    Allows specifying additional Test-Infrared products for use with datasets that may
    not have the standard Infrared channel.  This was used to create
    Test-Infrared-ABI-B13-Day-Night, -Day-Only, Night-Only products to allow running
    Infrared low res tiny sectors for the geocolor goes-18 test dataset, which did
    NOT have B14BT variable available.

- title: 'Add ABI B13 Infrared Day/Night integration test products'
  description: |
    Since the geocolor goes-18 test dataset does NOT contain B14, we can't use the
    standard Test-Infrared-Day-Night, etc integration test products.  Create an
    ABI B13 specific version of the Test products to allow running efficient low
    resolution integration tests using that dataset.
   
    This involved adding a Test-Infrared-ABI-B13 version to each integration test
    product YAML, just for ABI.

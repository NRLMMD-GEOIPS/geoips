testing and installation:
- title: 'Update call_cmd to explicitly request to use_print or use_logging, rather than toggle with use_logging'
  description: |
    Previously we just passed in use_logging, and if it was true we printed each line of
    the command output via LOG commands, and if it was false, we printed to the
    screen with print commands.  Sometimes we don't want to print to the screen
    at all (if we ONLY want to write to the log file), so allow requesting both
    use_print and use_logging separately so we can turn both off if we want.
    This makes for much nicer pytest output...

- title: 'Print TIME and LOGFILE in check_requirements run_command when exclusively redirecting to log file'
  description: |
    If we are only writing output to a log file and not printing or teeing
    to the terminal, include both the current time and the logfile name
    to the terminal prior to calling the command.  This allows more easily
    identifying and reviewing the current log output, as well as quickly
    seeing how long a given command has been running.

- title: 'Turn off log and print output in pytest-based integration testing'
  description: |
    To avoid ALL output from a command getting printed to the screen when
    a test fails (since it all gets redirected to a log file), use the
    new use_print and use_logging arguments to call_cmd to turn off both
    print and log.  Previously the LOG output didn't end up going to the
    terminal, I don't know why it started going to the terminal, but this
    ensures we don't print ANYTHING directly to the terminal when we are
    redirecting the pytest output to logs.

- title: 'Replace -s with --capture=no, make a note that I think we want -s and --tb=short for integration tests but not unit tests'
  description: |
    Since interactive_pytest.sh ensures all command output is redirected to logs
    for full review, keep the output to the terminal minimal.
    I don't think this applies for unit tests, since we only get the output
    pytest wants to give us from those, but we may want to shorten it up
    in the future if we feel we're getting too much spam to the terminal.

- title: 'More informative pytest-based integration test log filenames'
  description: |
    Include the basename of the current script in the log filename, as well as arguments.
    Also, ls -lthr the full log directory with every log.

    Also include UTC timestamp between each command within pytest.

    Since the log filename doesn't print until the pytest call is complete, print out
    the logdir up front so people can go look for the latest log.

bug fix:
- title: 'Return correct value from check output file list'
  description: |
    Previously did NOT return exit code from check_output_file_list, but relied on
    exit_state being set.  exit_state did not seem to actually be set even when
    sourcing this script, so just exit appropriately

- title: 'Print return codes from each test script in global_terminator_satzen.sh example script'
  description: |
    This is not actually run regularly, but to make it more useful, just print out
    all the return codes at the end so we can see what failed. Also copy all outputs
    to example_test_script_outputs

bug fix:
- title: 'Temporarily link VIIRS L1b SDR HDF5 files with supported satpy name'
  description: |
    The backend satpy reader in the viirs_sdr_hdf5 reader needs the creation time in the
    filename, and will not read in files if they do not include that time in the file
    name. Temporarily updated the viirs_sdr_hdf5 reader to softlink files to the cache
    directory, and use those links to read in the file. The reader uses the end time in
    the filename to create creation time. Files are unlinked at the end of the reader.

    For example, SVM16_j02_d20250305_t1043171_e1044418_b12004_oeac_ops.h5 will be linked
    to $GEOIPS_DATA_CACHE_DIR_SHORTTERM_CALIBRATED_DATA/viirs_sdr_hdf5_reader/SVM16_j02_d20250305_t1043171_e1044418_b12004_c202503051044418_oeac_ops.h5

bug fix:
- title: 'Allow passing satellite_zenith_angle_cutoff into geostationary readers.'
  description: |
    Previously all geostationary readers except for FCI had hard coded satellite
    zenith angle cutoffs (85 for Himawari, 75 for others). Add kwarg to all
    geostationary readers to allow passing in a value for masking all variables
    based on satellite zenith angle.

    Satellite zenith angle masking could also be handled within product/algorithm,
    but this will at least allow NOT masking based on satellite zenith angle within
    the readers, which will actually allow the satellite zenith angle cutoffs specified
    within the algorithms to be valid..

    NOTE satellite_zenith_angle_cutoff kwarg should NOT be explicitly included in
    geoips/interfaces/module_based/readers.py, since it is included in kwargs

- title: 'Allow reader_name as command line argument, and do not require definition within procflow config'
  description: |
    Previously reader_name had to be defined within the procflow configs, and would not
    be used if passed in command line for config based procflow.

    Update config_based.py to allow passing reader from the command line, which will
    override the reader_name if defined in procflow config.

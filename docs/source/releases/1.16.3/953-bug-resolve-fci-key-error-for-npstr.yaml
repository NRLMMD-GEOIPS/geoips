bug fix:
- title: 'Resolve KeyError in FCI reader when reading specific channels'
  description: |
    Set chans to list of GeoIPS variable names if none for consistency
    
    Previous behavior set chans to the list of available FCI variables, not the GeoIPS
    variable names. This caused inconsistencies when chans was not none, and was a list of
    GeoIPS variable names (which should always be the case). This inconsistency lead to
    a KeyError when trying to create the read_geoips_chans list, as we were trying to get
    the GeoIPS variable name from the CHAN_MAP dictionary. By setting chans to the GeoIPS
    variable name for each variable found in the FCI files, we do not need to do any
    mapping when creating read_geoips_chans.

    Note there are still issues with the FCI reader for multi-resolution self-registered
    reads.  This was discovered when attempting to run the geocolor fci.sh test script,
    but given it was never added to the integration test list when created in March 2025
    on github.com https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geocolor/pull/7 there is no indication
    when it stopped working.  We opened a new issue to address this multi-resolution
    self-register error in the fci reader, and it will be addressed in a separate Issue/branch/PR.
    Likely we will add an integration test product that we can use to test various combinations
    of self-register/sectored/multi-variable-multi-resolution in a simple generalized test
    product, so we can fully test the readers, allowing simplified tiny sector tests in
    individual repos such as geocolor (so we are not relying on geocolor tests to test 
    multi-resolution self-register reads...)

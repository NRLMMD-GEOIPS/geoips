    Related to *GEOIPS#312: Bug Fix: Update geostationary readers to support multiple scan times*

    New updates to readers ewsg_netcdf and ami_netcdf. With the new updates, the
    aforementioned readers are now able to take in multiple scan times of files and
    output them appropriately in a xarray dictionary format. Alongside these updates,
    we refactored readers changed in PR #427 (which addressed the issue above) to reduce
    code duplication. Now all of the readers which can read in multiple scan times have
    the same logic in their call functions regardless of the data being read in or the
    operations needed to read it.

    Note: we have not been able to acquire ews-g1 data yet and therefore have not been
    able to test the new changes as of the time of writing this.

    *From GEOIPS#714: 7-26-24, Discuss how to share LOG attribute in the CLI*

    Since we've started developing the GeoIPS CLI, we've known that there was a need to
    have a shared logger object among all of the CLI command classes for debugging
    purposes and to output basic information to the user if requested. We can now do
    this using the '--log-level' / '-log' flag. Depending on the log level set, all
    levels that match or are of higher 'order' than the log level provided will be
    outputted. This functionality matches that used in 'run_procflow'. Logging is now
    a supported utility throughout the CLI, and can be used in any CLI class via
    self.LOG.<log_level>(log_statement). Note that self.LOG.<log_level> does not have to
    match the provided '--log-level' ran in the command. This flag is strictly just the
    LOG level filter. I.e. if '--log-level info' was provided, levels
    ['info', 'debug', 'interactive'] would be shown. The lower the level, the more
    logging channels will output.

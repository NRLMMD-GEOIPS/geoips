  description: |
    I believe this will still work as long as the original error is included as
    str(err) within the output.  Previously the original error was not included,
    and the unit tests would fail because they are looking for a specific string
    within the error contents.

- title: 'Standardize base, full, and system pytest markers for better test separation'
  description: |
    * Remove all unit tests and test interfaces from check_code. This ensures check_code
      operates on the current repo only, and does not apply long-running pytests
      (unit tests/long) or checks that operate on all installed plugins (test_interfaces)
    * Add "system" pytest marker for integration tests that span multiple plugin repos.
      No tests that operate on any additional plugin repositories should be included
      in the "base", "full", or "extra" pytest markers.

      * "base" pytest marker intended to be a fast-running basic test of the CURRENT
        repos functionality
      * "full" pytest marker intended to be a complete test of the current repos
        functionality, but should not operate on any other repositories.
      * "extra" pytest marker operates only on the current repo, but includes
        non-standard or non-required tests.
      * "realtime" pytest marker allows testing specifically real-time functionality,
        currently unused but could be implemented for realtime processing tests.
    * Separate base_install.sh, full_install.sh, and system_install.sh to match
      functionality in base, full, and system markers.

    Allow consistent operation on all repos. Also move logs to consistent locations
    for various testing purposes to clean up $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS/logs.

    * $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS/logs/install for check_system_requirements.sh installation logs

bug fix:
- title: 'Add pad_x_scale_factor and pad_y_scale_factor to product_defaults schema'
  description: |
    * For now, explicitly add any new YAML product fields to schema
    * We may want to generalize this for OBP, but keep things explicit to better track
      what/how we are implementing things now.

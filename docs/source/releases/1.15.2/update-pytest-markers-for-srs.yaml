- title: 'Finalize pytest integration markers based on SRS'
  description: |
    The Software Requirements Specification includes very specific delineation between
    GeoIPS Core, GeoIPS Site, and GeoIPS System implementations.
    Update pytest markers based on the definitions in the SRS, and update all verbiage
    in integration tests / setup scripts.

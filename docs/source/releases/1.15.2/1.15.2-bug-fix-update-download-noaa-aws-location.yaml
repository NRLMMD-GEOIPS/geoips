- title: 'Update download_noaa_aws.sh script to write to GEOIPS_OUTDIRS'
  description: |
    Previously download_noaa_aws.sh wrote to $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR/test_data_noaa_aws.
    Update to now write to $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS/noaa_aws_downloads, test_data_noaa_aws
    will now be a static test data repository of datasets originally downloaded from
    NOAA AWS, and dynamically/interactively downloaded datasets will be written to
    $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS by default.

bug fix:
- title: 'Cast radius of influence to float when passing to interp_kd_tree'
  description: |
    With numpy 2.0 / netcdf upgrade, some readers now return np.float64 for radius of
    influence.  Pyresample fails with

    * TypeError radius_of_influence must be number

    Cast to float within pyresample wrapper to avoid errors.

- title: 'No longer support bug in datetime64 scaling'
  description: |
    This was a bug until numpy 2.x with improperly handling scaling factors for
    numpy datetime64 objects.  It now appears to work correctly, so remove the hard
    coded 1e-9 scaling factor.

    I am honestly not exactly sure how this worked before, but changing the default
    scaling from 1e-9 to 1 works now, and 1e-9 default scaling worked for numpy < 2.
    My best guess is that the datetime64's were stored improperly with numpy < 2, so
    when it thought it was units of seconds, it was actually units of nanoseconds, so
    we always had to use the 1e-9 scale factor, regardless of whether it said it
    was seconds or nanoseconds.

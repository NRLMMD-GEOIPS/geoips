bug fix:
  - title: "Ensure plugin-is-valid passes with type hints in plugin call signature"
    description: |
      Previously if a plugin had type hints within the call signature, the return
      value of inspect.signature was not being parsed properly, and the plugin
      was not being recognized as valid.  Ensure we use only the argument name
      for comparison against the list of allowed arguments.

      Note currently plugin_is_valid is only tested by calling
      tests/utils/test_interfaces.py, in the future call signatures will be
      validated differently, but we want to ensure this test is regularly
      run to ensure compliance with expected call signature formatting
      as much as possible.

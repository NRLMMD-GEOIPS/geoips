enhancement:
- title: 'Track resource usage at checkpoints, add zarr hooks to geostationary readers'
  description: |
    Add new "track_resource_usage" and "checkpoint_usage_stats" methods to the
    memusg.PidLog class. The "track_resource_usage" method allows for more detailed
    profiling of resource usage statistics at specified checkpoints in a procflow. The
    "checkpoint_usage_stats" method returns a dictionary of each checkpoint with the
    recorded resource usage statistics. These detailed resource usage statistics can be
    written to the database if both `--product_db` and `--store_checkpoint_statistics`
    are passed to the procflow.These checkpoints are currently limited to the
    config_based procflow, and in geostationary readers (including
    readers.geostationary_geolocation).

    Also updated the ewsg_netcdf, ahi_hsd, ami_netcdf, and seviri_hrit readers to
    include hooks for toggling between using memmap or zarr as the backend for storing
    pre-calcuated geostationary geolocation data. (Note the ewsg_netcdf reader has the
    hooks, but the settings are not actively used. Added for consistency with the other
    geostationary readers.)

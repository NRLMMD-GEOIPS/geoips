Bug Fixes
=========

Fixed from scipy.ndimage.interpolation import zoom deprecation warning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The scipy.ndimage.interpolation library has recently been deprecated, and was causing
warnings when importing the zoom libary for the ahi_hsd reader and the abi_netcdf reader

The following files have been modified to remove those deprecation warnings.

    * modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/readers/abi_netcdf.py
    * modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/readers/ahi_hsd.py

Documentation
-------------

Added the v_11_5a0.rst to the releases documentation. v1_11_3a0 has recently been
released, so we need a new release form to document our changes.

    * added: geoips/docs/source/releases/v_11_5a0.rst


Git Workflow Updates
====================

Remove flake8_docstring_only option from check_code.sh workflow call
--------------------------------------------------------------------

flake8 errors now corrected throughout geoips repo - fully enforce flake8
from the github actions workflow.

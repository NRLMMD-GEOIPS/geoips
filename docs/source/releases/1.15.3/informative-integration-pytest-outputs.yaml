- title: 'Provide more informative integration pytest output when running with -s'
  description: |
    Output reference environment variables (like OUTPUT_CHECKER_THRESHOLD_IMAGE), and the full
    copy pasteable command line call for each test script. Remove some other print statements.
    Should determine if there is some concept of logging levels in pytests (using geoips
    setup_logging did not appear to immediately work with initial tests).

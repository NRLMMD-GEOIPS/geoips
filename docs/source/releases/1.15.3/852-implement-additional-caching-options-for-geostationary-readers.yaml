enhancement:
- title: 'Implement additional caching options for ABI geostationary reader'
  description: |
    Add support for optionally caching solar angle calculations in either memmap or
    zarray format. Solar angle calculations are stored under a "short term" directory,
    so any files under that directory can be subject to aggressive scrubbing without the
    worry of deleting "long term" caches (e.g. lat/lon/sat_azimuth/sat_zenith).

    In addition to the optional solar angle caching, the abi_netcdf reader was updated
    to support the optional caching of both radiance and calibrated data. The abi_satpy
    and ahi_satpy readers are considerably faster, likely due to the caching of both the
    solar angles and the data itself.

    The environment variables that control the cache location have been standardized
    under base_paths.py, and are assigned the following names:
    GEOIPS_DATA_CACHE_DIR_LONGTERM_GEOLOCATION_DYNAMIC,
    GEOIPS_DATA_CACHE_DIR_LONGTERM_GEOLOCATION_STATIC,
    GEOIPS_DATA_CACHE_DIR_SHORTERM_GEOLOCATION_SOLAR_ANGLES,
    GEOIPS_DATA_CACHE_DIR_SHORTTERM_CALIBRATED_DATA,
    SATPY_DATA_CACHE_DIR_SHORTTERM_CALIBRATED_DATA,
    SATPY_DATA_CACHE_DIR_SHORTERM_GEOLOCATION_SOLAR_ANGLES.

    The variables above use derived paths from either GEOIPS_DATA_CACHE_DIR or
    SATPY_DATA_CACHE_DIR, which can both be set in the config_geoips script. Presently,
    both of those paths will default to $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS/cache/geoips and
    $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS/cache/satpy, respectively.

    Add new config based test script for processing ABI visible and Infrared data while
    using the solar angle and data caching options.

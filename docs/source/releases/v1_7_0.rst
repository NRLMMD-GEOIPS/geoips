Version 1.7.0 (2023-02-15)
**************************************


Regression Fixes
================

Force matplotlib to v3.6.3 until we can update all test outputs
---------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#184: 2023-02-15, version update*

* matplotlib 3.7.0 causes slight changes in labels for annotated imagery outputs
* Note when we update all outputs, we will also switch from conda install of
  matplotlib and cartopy to pip install.

::

    setup.py
    setup.sh

Update format for SAR coverage start and end time
-------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#139: 2023-02-10, Update SAR reader for new coverage start and end time format*

* Until 20221103, SAR coverage start and end time was formatted as YYYYMMDDTHHMNSS
* As of 20221105, updated to YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MN:SSZ
* Update reader to support both (old and new file formats)
* Added B-deck file with coverage over a SAR file with the new format.

    new file: tests/sectors/tc_bdecks/bsh112023.dat

Bug fixes
=========

Fix minor issues during docs build
----------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#166: 2023-01-31, fix minor issues during docs build*

* Remove imports of ``collections.Hashable`` from ``ahi_hsd`` and
  ``abi_netcdf`` readers.
* Remove import of ``IPython.embed`` from ``modis_hdf4`` reader.
* Ignore GeoIPS.pdf in ``.gitignore``.


Testing Updates
===============

Extend SAR incident angle plots to 70 degrees
---------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#141: 2023-02-10, Increase range for SAR incident angle plots*

Some SAR satellites have retrievals very near edge of scan, so increase the
allowed range for the incident angle plots to cover to the edge.  This will
impact any test outputs.

* Add ticks for 55, 60, 65, 70 degrees
* Increase range from [15, 50] to [15, 70] degrees

Documentation Updates
=====================

Update all release note distro statements to use RST-formatting
---------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#184: 2023-02-15, version update*

* Use ``| # # #`` for release note distro statements

::

    modified: docs/source/releases/*.rst


Convert CHANGELOG from md to rst
--------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#172: 2023-02-06, convert CHANGELOG from md to rst*

* RST supports sphinx-built release notes - can copy CHANGELOG.rst directly to
  release notes on version update.
* Used pandoc, with slight modifications after convert to match current release notes
* Formatted to match CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.rst requirements

::

    renamed/modified: CHANGELOG.md -> CHANGELOG.rst

Removed test_data_amsr2 section from v1.6.0 release notes
---------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#172: 2023-02-06, convert CHANGELOG from md to rst*

* Removed GEOIPS#11 section from v1.6.0 release notes

  * This was already included in v1.6.1

::

    modified: docs/source/releases/logs/v1_6_0.rst

Convert CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE from md to rst
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#172: 2023-02-06, convert CHANGELOG from md to rst*

* Rearrange to be in same order as release.yml (with similar headers)
* Update to always include top level header of Issue ID, date, and summary

  * This will NOT be included in the release notes - used to separate PRs until
    next release
  * Actual changes will be sorted into the second level header label categories
    when generating the release notes during the release process.

* Update to always include second level headers of "label" categories
* Update to always include a summary of each individual change as a third level
  header

  * This allows proper summarization of all changes via RST headers.

* Update to always include the Issue ID / PR summary with each third level individual
  change header

  * These will all be sorted into the second level header label categories during
    version release, so including the Issue ID and PR summary with each change will
    facilitate rapidly re-organizing the CHANGELOG into the release notes, and still
    maintaining a connection to the original PRs.

* Update to always include list of changed files under each third level individual
  change header

::

    renamed/modified: CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.md -> CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.rst

* Update to match new CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.rst formatting

    new file: docs/source/releases/logs/v1_6_1.rst
    new file: docs/source/releases/logs/v1_6_3.rst

Update all release notes to match standardized format
-----------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#172: 2023-02-06, convert CHANGELOG from md to rst*

* Top level header of "Version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)"
* Second level headers of label categories (like release.yml)
* Third level headers of actual individual changes

  * Include reference to Issue ID and PR summary with each individual change

* NOTE: Only v1.6.x release notes were fully updated - others only finalized
  as far as the top level header.

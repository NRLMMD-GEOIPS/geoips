Version 1.4.6 (2022-04-18)
**************************

v1.4.6: 2022-04-18, metadata\_tc, center\_radius\_rgba, coverage check info in metadata, real-time bug fixes

Major New Functionality
=======================

Product Display
---------------

* Add "cbar\_label" kwarg to all passive microwave colormaps

    * Allows passing "cbar_lable" from product inputs and product params YAMLs

* Add Coverage Function information

Coverage Checks
---------------

* Add center\_radius\_rgba coverage check

    * use arr[:, :, 3] alpha layer for masked values rather than arr.mask

Metadata YAML outputs
---------------------

* Add new metadata\_tc output format

    * metadata_default will NOT change, for consistent general test outputs
    * Include coverage check function information within metadata_tc.

* single\_source.py/config\_based.py

    * Allow passing "product_name" to metadata output format modules (via metadata_fname_dict kwarg)

        * This allows accessing information via "dev/product.py" interfaces for metadata outputs

Database Hooks
--------------

* Add hooks for accessing modules capable of generating and populating a database of product outputs during
    geoips processing

Command line arguments
----------------------

* --product\_db\_writer: Controls interface module used to populate product database by single\_source procflow
* --product\_db\_writer\_override: Adds ability to override database interface modules set under the
        available sectors in the output config file

Improvements
============

Coverage Checks
---------------

* dev/product.py

    * allow alternate field name for coverage funcs in output config
    * Defaults to "covg_func" and "covg_args"
    * Pass "covg_args_field_name" to get_covg_args_from_product or get_covg_from_product to use alternative
        field name
    * This allows specifying multiple coverage check functions (ie, one for image_production and one for fnames)

* single\_source.py/config\_based.py

    * Use "image_production_covg_*" when determining if there is sufficient coverage
        to generate an output product

        * Defaults to use "covg_func" if "image_production_covg_*" not defined

area_def_adjusters
------------------

* Support list\_xarray\_list\_variables\_to\_area\_def\_out\_fnames adjuster\_type

    * Allows returning list of output filenames, in addition to adjusted area def
    * Allows producing valid output products via an area_def_adjuster

Bug fixes
=========

Real-time processing
--------------------

* Reduce tc\_fname remove duplicates search time from 10 min to 3 min

    * This was previously deleting geostationary products from consecutive collect times.

* Update search time for matching dynamic sector times to -6h to +9h

    * ie, data can come up to 9h after sector time and still match given sector.
    * This allows for TC sector updates delayed up to 9h during real-time processing

Coverage Checks
---------------

* center\_radius coverage check

    * previously computed the circle based on radius in pixels rather than radius in km
    * Update so we convert radius in km to pixels prior to passing into center_radius coverage check.

        * radius_pixels = radius_km / res_km
        * Results in higher coverage for many products (with resolution > 1km)

1.4.6post1 Post Release Patch (2022-04-21)
==========================================

Bug fixes
=========

* Update cartopy map data pull to ensure v5.0.0 natural earth vector data (required for test outputs)

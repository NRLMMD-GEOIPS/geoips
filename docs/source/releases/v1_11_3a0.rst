Bug Fixes
=========

Add v1_11_3a0 to release note index
-----------------------------------

Documentation build fails when RST files are missing from the index.

::

  modified: docs/source/releases/index.rst

Require sphinx<7.2 in pyproject.toml
------------------------------------

Sphinx version 7.2 introduced a bug in the autodoc function, causing an import
error in the interp_gauss module.  Force sphinx version < 7.2 until that error
has been resolved.

::

  modified: pyproject.toml

Enhancements
============

Replace xRITDecompress with pyPublicDecompWT for seviri_hrit reader
-------------------------------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#264: 2023-08-16, Update seviri reader to use pyPublicDecompWT*

* We had previously been using xRITDecompress which needed to be complied and installed
  separately. This replaces xRITDecompress with pyPublicDecompWT which provides the same
  functionality but can be pip installed.

::

    modified: geoips/plugins/modules/readers/utils/hrit_reader.py

Installation Updates
====================

Add pyPublicDecompWT to dependencies and remove setup_seviri from setup script

Installation Updates
====================

Add .vscode repository to full Installation
-------------------------------------------

When running full_install.sh/full_test.sh, ensure the .vscode repository is
cloned along with other source repos.

Also added "settings_repo" option to check_system_requirements (only clones,
does not attempt to pip install or uncompress test data)

::

  modified: tests/integration_tests/full_install.sh
  modified: setup/check_system_requirements.sh

Add script to enable geoips environment

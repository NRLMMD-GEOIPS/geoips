Bug Fixes
=========

Add v1_11_3a0 to release note index
-----------------------------------

Documentation build fails when RST files are missing from the index.

::

  modified: docs/source/releases/index.rst

Require sphinx<7.2 in pyproject.toml
------------------------------------

Sphinx version 7.2 introduced a bug in the autodoc function, causing an import
error in the interp_gauss module.  Force sphinx version < 7.2 until that error
has been resolved.

Version 1.11.1a0 (2023-08-15)
*****************************

Improve overall GeoIPS functionality, and added new GeoIPS sectors.

* Added new GeoIPS sectors to improve plotting specific regions along the globe.
* Update GeoIPS sector metadata implementation to allow more data to be contained.
* Updated coverage checkers to use either varname or product name.
* Added slack channel to README.md.
* Made TPW colormappers use find_ascii_palette() instead of searching through filesystem.

Documentation Updates
=====================

Added slack channel to README.md.
---------------------------------

From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#241: 2023-07-18

Appended a slack channel section to README.md for users who are interested or applicable
to join the GeoIPS slack channel. It seems as if people from CIMSS and others want access
to this channel.

Enhancements
============

Added new sectors to geiops/geoips/plugins/yaml/sectors/static/
---------------------------------------------------------------

From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#111: 2023-04-02

There are currently very few sectors in GeoIPS. This adds many new sectors to GeoIPS
for users to use easily.

Refactoring Updates
===================

Changed GeoIPS sector Metadata Implementation
---------------------------------------------

From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#248: 2023-08-02

Currently, sector metadata is very constricting. It only allows you to specify the 
region in which the sector lies. This new change not only allows for more data to 
be contained in sector metadata, but also allows for different families of metadata.

The families of metadata adhere to the different families of static sectors. This includes:

::
    atmos_river
    pyrocb
    static
    stitched
    tc
    volcano

For the sector metadata to adhere to there corresponding sector family, these schema YAMLs were added.

::
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/area_definition_atmosriver.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/area_definition_pyrocb.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/area_definition_static.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/area_definition_stitched.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/area_definition_tc.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/area_definition_volcano.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/specs/static_sector_spec.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/metadata_familes/atmosriver.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/metadata_familes/pyrocb.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/metadata_familes/static.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/metadata_familes/stitched.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/metadata_familes/tc.yaml
    added: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/metadata_familes/volcano.yaml

These new files remove the need to have only one area_definition.yaml, so these files were removed.

::
    deleted: geoips/geoips/schema/sectors/area_definition.yaml

With these new updates and changes, modification of some files was required to get this all to work.
This includes:

::
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/filename_formatters/geoips_fname.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/yaml/sectors/static/conus.yaml

    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/yaml/sectors/static/japan.yaml
    modified: geoips/geoips/sector_utils/esimate_area_extent.py

Update Coverage Checkers to use either varname or product name
--------------------------------------------------------------

From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#227: 2023-05-09

Currently coverage_checkers determine which variable to check for coverage by:

::
    If present, alt_varname from the yaml
    If present, varname from the yaml
    Looking for a variable with the same name as the product

This should be cleaned up to just be varname or the product name. We should ditch alt_varname.
To untangle the ambiguous naming from coverage_checkers, we removed the variables alt_varname
and force_alt_varname. This required changes to these files:

::
    modified: geoips/geoips/interfaces/module_based/coverage_checkers.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/coverage_checkers/center_radius_rgba.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/coverage_checkers/center_radius.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/coverage_checkers/masked_arrays.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/coverage_checkers/numpy_arrays_nan.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/coverage_checkers/rgba.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/coverage_checkers/windbarbs.py

Implement find_ascii_palette for TPW colormappers
-------------------------------------------------

From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#226: 2023-05-09

Previously, TPW colormappers selected the correct ascii palette by searching through
the GeoIPS directory. This is inefficient and has the possibility to cause problems if
the directory structure changes eventually. 

It was implemented using gpaths["BASE_PATH"] to find the TPW ascii palettes, but now 
uses the new "find_ascii_palettes" utility. Therefore changes to these files were required:

::
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/colormappers/tpw/tpw_cimss.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/colormappers/tpw/tpw_purple.py
    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/colormappers/tpw/tpw_pwat.py

Bug Fixes
=========

Update error messages in "bad" product_defaults tests
-----------------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#255: 2023-08-09, Fix error matching regex*

* jsonschema changed their error messages to add additional quotes. This just modifies
  our test regex to ignore more of the error.

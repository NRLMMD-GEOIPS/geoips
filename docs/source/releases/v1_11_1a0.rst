Bug Fixes
=========

Update error messages in "bad" product_defaults tests
-----------------------------------------------------

*From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#255: 2023-08-09, Fix error matching regex*

* jsonschema changed their error messages to add additional quotes. This just modifies
  our test regex to ignore more of the error.

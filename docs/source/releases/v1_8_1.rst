Version 1.8.1 (2023-03-22)
**************************

* Rename SSMI/S 89GHz products to 91GHz
* Update F-16 SSMI/S scaling for channels 12-16
* Ensure test_full_install both clones and installs available plugins
* Resolve basename: extra operands error in tests
* Add geoips_clavrx to test_full_install.sh
* Minor sphinx build updates

Breaking Changes
================

Rename 89GHz SSMI/S products to 91GHz
-------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#198: 2023-03-15, SSMI/S 89GHz -> 91GHz*

We are moving away from categorically naming products, instead using the actual
frequency in the product and file names.

We could potentially use the "product_template" field in the future to categorize
products into different groupings - but the actual product names themselves should
be accurate.

Major New Functionality
=======================

Add geoips_clavrx to test_full_install.sh
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#212: 2023-03-22, add geoips_clavrx to test_full_install*

Add geoips_clavrx plugin clone and install, test_data_clavrx clone, and geoips_clavrx
test calls to test_full_install.sh, to ensure it is included in integration tests.

Regression Fixes
================

Correct minor sphinx build warnings
-----------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#206: 2023-03-22, minor sphinx build warnings*

Fix minor warnings in sphinx documentation builds

#. footer_items -> footer_start in conf.py
#. Update incorrect path to NRL_logo_RGB.jpg in conf.py
#. Ensure GeoIPS.pdf is created even for pdf_required != "True"

   * GeoIPS.pdf download link included in html documentation by default. Must
     exist or sphinx warning due to missing file.

Bug Fixes
=========

Resolve basename: extra operands error in tests
-----------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#214: 2023-03-22, resolve basename test error*

Do not attempt to take the basename of the script path PLUS arguments - only
take basename of script path.

    modified: tests/utils/test_all_run.sh

Update SSMI/S scaling for F-16 datasets after 7 March
-----------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#134: 2023-03-15, fix SSMI/S F-16 37GHz scaling*

Update SSMI/S reader to apply appropriate scaling for F-16 channels 12-16 datasets
(including 37GHz products).

When the rev numbers rolled back to 0 on 7 March, the
rev number check began failing, resulting in incorrectly scaled imagery (scaling
changed with rev 12216, so code was initially applying a new scaling for rev>12216,
which failed when the rev rolled back to 0).

Now only apply the old scaling if rev < 12216 AND year < 2023.

Update xobj.platform_name -> xobjs["METADATA"].platform_name for config_based
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#198: 2023-03-15, SSMI/S 89GHz -> 91GHz*

I have no idea how this was not fixed sooner...

Installation Updates
====================

Add notes to test_full_install.sh that gfortran and git required
----------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#210: 2023-03-22, install geoips plugins in test_full_install*

* Note that gfortran version compatible with f2py required for recenter_tc akima build
* Note that git required for git lfs test repos

::

    modified: tests/test_full_install.sh

Update test_full_install.sh to clone and install plugins
--------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#210: 2023-03-22, install geoips plugins in test_full_install*

Previously was only cloning plugin packages, not installing, so recenter_tc and
data_fusion tests failed.

Update so plugin packages are cloned AND installed.  Eventually this will be
replaced with a direct pip install (without cloning)

    modified: setup.sh

Update test_full_install.sh to clone and install plugins
--------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#210: 2023-03-22, install geoips plugins in test_full_install*

data_fusion tests failed.

Refactoring Updates
===================

*From issue GEOIPS#16: 2023-03-20, move database write functions to geoips_db*

Move database write functions to geoips_db.

::

    modified: geoips/interface_modules/procflows/config_based.py

Test Repo Updates
=================

Renamed SSMI/S 89GHz test output to 91GHz
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#198: 2023-03-15, SSMI/S 89GHz -> 91GHz*

Rename test script and test outputs from 89 to 91GHz (contents did not change,
because no titles/labels in the unsectored test output).

::

    renamed: tests/outputs/ssmis.color89.unprojected_image/20200519.084400.F16.ssmis.color89.self_register.100p00.DMSP.15p0.png -> tests/outputs/ssmis.color91.unprojected_image/20200519.084400.F16.ssmis.color91.self_register.100p00.DMSP.15p0.png
    renamed: tests/scripts/ssmis.color89.unprojected_image.sh -> tests/scripts/ssmis.color91.unprojected_image.sh

Documentation Updates
=====================

Note developer can update docs/source/releases directly in CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.rst
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#172: 2023-03-15, RST CHANGELOG and release notes*

Make a note in CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.rst that CHANGELOG.rst gets moved to
docs/source/releases/vX_Y_Z.rst (where X.Y.Z is the NEXT version),
during the PR review process, and the developer can make changes directly
in docs/source/releases/vX_Y_Z.rst if they understand the process, and
want to save a step.

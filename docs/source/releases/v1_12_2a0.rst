Enhancements
============

Add function to list all available interfaces for each interface 'family'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#397: 2023-11-02, Add function to geoips.interfaces to list all interfaces of each type*

Added a function which lists all interfaces found for each interface family. Rather than
referring to a hard-coded list of interfaces that currently exist, we make assumptions
on the directory structure of the geoips package and list the corresponding interface
modules via the members of 'geoips.interfaces'.

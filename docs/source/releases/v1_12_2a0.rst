=============

Added Documentation for create_plugin_registries and PluginRegistry Class
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the addition of create_plugin_registries and the new PluginRegistry Class, we have
a need to add documentation describing what these do, how they are used, and the
benefits that come from adding them to the main GeoIPS code. This branch does exactly
that, and adds a section under 'UserGuide' describing what these pieces of code actually
do.

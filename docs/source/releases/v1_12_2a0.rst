Version 1.12.2a0 (2024-02-19)
*****************************

* Enhancements

  * Initial Stage of the GeoIPS CLI
* Bug fixes

  * Ensure that log.interactive works from plugins when imported independently.
  * Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors.
  * Modify algorithm_interpolator_colormapper to only provide input xarray
* Refactor

  * Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable

Bug Fixes
=========

algorithm_interpolator_colormapper incorrectly interpolates data
----------------------------------------------------------------

This was found during the development for the GLM reader. Apparently, at line 1033 of
single_source.py procflow, when trying to interpolate data under the
algorithm_interpolator_colormapper family, we call 'interp_plugin' with the same
input and output xarray. This makes no sense, and needs to be fixed. It wasn't changing
the data in this format. To fix it, we leave input_xarray as 'alg_xarray', and set
output_xarray to 'None'. This is handled properly in the interpolator, and will modify
coordinate arrays to fit the shape of the interpolated data. I've checked config_based,
and this doesn't occur for that procflow.

Make add_log_level a callable class, ensure log.interactive works consistently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Move addition of interactive log level into __init__*
*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors*

Remove call to ``add_log_level()`` from ``setup_logging()`` and into ``geoips/__init__.py``.
This makes ``log.interactive()`` available to all components of GeoIPS, regardless of how
they are accessed. Previously, if a plugin was used without the rest of GeoIPS (e.g. a
reader) it would raise an ``AttributeError`` if it called ``log.interactive()``.

This additionally makes add_log_level into a callable class called LogLevelAdder which must
be instantiated prior to use. This fixes a problem where AttributeErrors were raised from
time to time. The way that they occurred required them to be ignored, even when they were
useful. Now, only useful AttributeErrors should be raised.

Remove unnessesary checks for and mentions of imagemagick
---------------------------------------------------------
..
  *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#: YYYY-MM-DD, Removed unnecessary requirement for imagemagick*

In v1.11.3a0 imagemagick functionality was replaced with other libraries. As such,
imagemagick was no longder a dependancy. However, the installation docs, Dockerfile, 
and setup scripts were not updated to reflect this change at the time. This fixes a 
bug during installation where the user is forced to install imagemagick to pass tests
despite it no longer being used. It also updates the documentation accordingly.

Refactor
========

Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#429: 2024-02-02, Plugin Registries Should Be Readable*

Currently, the JSON output of the plugin registries is a hodge-podge full of text. We
should refactor the way in which these plugin registries are outputted, so that they are
in a human readable, interpretable format. To do so, we need to add the argument
``indent=4`` to the ``json.dump`` call in ``write_plugin_registries``.

Enhancements
============

Initial Stage of the GeoIPS CLI
-------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#37: 2022-08-11, Create a useful CLI for GeoIPS.*

GeoIPS currently runs off of a few command scripts scattered throughout the code. The
only way a user could discover this is by reading the documentation, or looking through
the pyproject.toml to discover what scripts/commands are executable at the commandline.

To fix this, we are beginning to implement a new GeoIPS CLI, which will be called via
``geoips <command> <sub-command>``. This will allow the user to easily query and/or
execute geoips without having extensive knowledge of the lower-level implementations of
GeoIPS.

Currently, the GeoIPS CLI implements config, get, list, run, and validate commands. We
expect that we will change how ``run`` works, as well as add additional commands such as
``test``.

You can find more detailed information about each command at
``geoips/geoips/commandline/ancillary_info/cmd_instructions.yaml``. Below, we'll detail
to a minimal extent what each command does.

``geoips config`` implements configuration commands which are used to modify and/or
set up your GeoIPS environment. Currently, we implement installation methods for
downloading and decompressing test datasets. This is called via
``geoips config install <test_dataset_name>``.

``geoips get`` implements a variety of commands which retrieve additional information
about GeoIPS artifacts. Artifacts are a high level term for software pieces implemented
throughout GeoIPS. This includes individual plugins, interfaces, families, and top-level
packages.

``geoips list`` implements a variety of list methods which are used to detail what
artifacts exist throughout the GeoIPS Environment, or at a package specific level. We
currently support listing an individual interface, available interfaces, implemented
interfaces in a certain/all package[s], packages, scripts, and test-datasets.

``geoips run`` is an easy way to run a certain test script contained within a GeoIPS
package. These scripts must be placed in the ``<pkg_name>/tests/scripts`` directory and
be implemented via a ``*.sh`` bash script. This is an easier method to run your test
scripts opposed to traversing to the explicit directory and running the bash script
manually. We expect this command will change greatly as we continue to develop the CLI
and implement the order based procflow.

``geoips test`` implements a few methods to run testing scattered throughout GeoIPS
and other GeoIPS packages. It functions similar to run, but instead of being limited
to just executing normal test scripts, we can also run integration tests, liniting,
and unit tests. Since we expect ``geoips run`` to change in the future, we've
implemented this command to execute testing protocols for the foreseeable future.

``geoips validate`` implements a simple method of validating a certain plugin found
at the specified filepath. We expect this command will do more in the future, but for
the meantime, this command will validate the plugin using the associated interface
defined in the aforementioned plugin.

For an example of how to run the GeoIPS CLI, see the code section below.
.. code-block:: bash

    # Install the test_data_clavrx Test Dataset from CIRA's Nextcloud Instance
    geoips config install test_data_clavrx
    # All Interfaces GeoIPS and other GeoIPS Packages will be listed including all of
    # The plugin names that exist in that type of interface
    geoips list interface algorithms
    # Retrieve the 'single_channel' algorithm plugin and output information related
    # to it
    geoips get plugin algorithms single_channel
    # Will run the script under <script_name>.sh as it would execute ./<script_name>.sh
    # run_procflow command in the corresponding tests/scripts directory
    geoips run geoips abi.static.Infrared.imagery_annotated.sh
    # Example of how to validate a specific plugin
    geoips validate /home/evan/geoips/geoips_packages/geoips/geoips/plugins/yaml/products/abi.yaml

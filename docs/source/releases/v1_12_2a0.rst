Version 1.12.2a0 (2024-02-21)
*****************************

* Bug fixes

  * Ensure that log.interactive works from plugins when imported independently.
  * Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors.

* Refactor

  * Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable



Bug Fixes
=========

Make add_log_level a callable class, ensure log.interactive works consistently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Move addition of interactive log level into __init__*
*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors*

Remove call to ``add_log_level()`` from ``setup_logging()`` and into ``geoips/__init__.py``.
This makes ``log.interactive()`` available to all components of GeoIPS, regardless of how
they are accessed. Previously, if a plugin was used without the rest of GeoIPS (e.g. a
reader) it would raise an ``AttributeError`` if it called ``log.interactive()``.

This additionally makes add_log_level into a callable class called LogLevelAdder which must
be instantiated prior to use. This fixes a problem where AttributeErrors were raised from
time to time. The way that they occurred required them to be ignored, even when they were
useful. Now, only useful AttributeErrors should be raised.

Refactor
========

Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#429: 2024-02-02, Plugin Registries Should Be Readable*

Currently, the JSON output of the plugin registries is a hodge-podge full of text. We
should refactor the way in which these plugin registries are outputted, so that they are
in a human readable, interpretable format. To do so, we need to add the argument
``indent=4`` to the ``json.dump`` call in ``write_plugin_registries``.

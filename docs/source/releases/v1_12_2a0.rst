Refactor
========

Modify create_plugin_registries to use argparse
-----------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#416: 2023-12-21, Replace create_plugin_registries 'sys.argv' calls with 'argparse' library'*

Currently create_plugin_registries.py uses sys.argv calls to generate its arguments
rather than argparse. This doesn't follow GeoIPS conventions nor that of the CLI that
will soon be updated. We should replace these calls with argparse architecture, so that
this code follows current conventions, as does other GeoIPS code.

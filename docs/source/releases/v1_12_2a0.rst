Version 1.12.2a0 (2024-02-21)
*****************************


* Bug fixes

  * Ensure that log.interactive works from plugins when imported independently.
  * Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors.
  * Modify algorithm_interpolator_colormapper to only provide input xarray


* Refactor

  * Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable


Bug Fixes
=========

algorithm_interpolator_colormapper incorrectly interpolates data
----------------------------------------------------------------

This was found during the development for the GLM reader. Apparently, at line 1033 of
single_source.py procflow, when trying to interpolate data under the
algorithm_interpolator_colormapper family, we call 'interp_plugin' with the same
input and output xarray. This makes no sense, and needs to be fixed. It wasn't changing
the data in this format. To fix it, we leave input_xarray as 'alg_xarray', and set
output_xarray to 'None'. This is handled properly in the interpolator, and will modify
coordinate arrays to fit the shape of the interpolated data. I've checked config_based,
and this doesn't occur for that procflow.

Make add_log_level a callable class, ensure log.interactive works consistently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Move addition of interactive log level into __init__*
*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors*

Remove call to ``add_log_level()`` from ``setup_logging()`` and into ``geoips/__init__.py``.
This makes ``log.interactive()`` available to all components of GeoIPS, regardless of how
they are accessed. Previously, if a plugin was used without the rest of GeoIPS (e.g. a
reader) it would raise an ``AttributeError`` if it called ``log.interactive()``.

This additionally makes add_log_level into a callable class called LogLevelAdder which must
be instantiated prior to use. This fixes a problem where AttributeErrors were raised from
time to time. The way that they occurred required them to be ignored, even when they were
useful. Now, only useful AttributeErrors should be raised.

Remove unnessesary checks for and mentions of imagemagick
---------------------------------------------------------
..
  *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#: YYYY-MM-DD, Removed unnecessary requirement for imagemagick*

In v1.11.3a0 imagemagick functionality was replaced with other libraries. As such,
imagemagick was no longder a dependancy. However, the installation docs, Dockerfile, 
and setup scripts were not updated to reflect this change at the time. This fixes a 
bug during installation where the user is forced to install imagemagick to pass tests
despite it no longer being used. It also updates the documentation accordingly.

Refactor
========

Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#429: 2024-02-02, Plugin Registries Should Be Readable*

Currently, the JSON output of the plugin registries is a hodge-podge full of text. We
should refactor the way in which these plugin registries are outputted, so that they are
in a human readable, interpretable format. To do so, we need to add the argument
``indent=4`` to the ``json.dump`` call in ``write_plugin_registries``.

Enhancements
============

Documentation Scaffold for Coding Standards
-------------------------------------------
This update introduces a scaffold for the documentation of coding standards
for the project, aiming to ultimately enhance code consistency and quality. It
outlines the anticipated content and structure for these standards, providing
a clear framework for future contributions. The new documentation file is
located in the build/dev directory so that it is exempt from sphinx builds.


Added Log with Emphasis function
--------------------------------

Scattered throughout GeoIPS (and other packages too), are many Log statements that use
'***********************...' to emphasize the content in between them. While this is
easy to see in the Log output, it's extremely cluttered in the actual code. For this
reason, I've added a 'log_with_emphasis' function to handle this. All you need to do now
is 'log_with_emphasis(LOG.<log_type>, message)', and it will do the rest for you.

Bug Fixes
=========

algorithm_interpolator_colormapper incorrectly interpolates data
----------------------------------------------------------------

This was found during the development for the GLM reader. Apparently, at line 1033 of
single_source.py procflow, when trying to interpolate data under the
algorithm_interpolator_colormapper family, we call 'interp_plugin' with the same
input and output xarray. This makes no sense, and needs to be fixed. It wasn't changing
the data in this format. To fix it, we leave input_xarray as 'alg_xarray', and set
output_xarray to 'None'. This is handled properly in the interpolator, and will modify
coordinate arrays to fit the shape of the interpolated data. I've checked config_based,
and this doesn't occur for that procflow.

Make add_log_level a callable class, ensure log.interactive works consistently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Move addition of interactive log level into __init__*
*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors*

Remove call to ``add_log_level()`` from ``setup_logging()`` and into ``geoips/__init__.py``.
This makes ``log.interactive()`` available to all components of GeoIPS, regardless of how
they are accessed. Previously, if a plugin was used without the rest of GeoIPS (e.g. a
reader) it would raise an ``AttributeError`` if it called ``log.interactive()``.

This additionally makes add_log_level into a callable class called LogLevelAdder which must
be instantiated prior to use. This fixes a problem where AttributeErrors were raised from
time to time. The way that they occurred required them to be ignored, even when they were
useful. Now, only useful AttributeErrors should be raised.

Update Dockerfile to install rasterio properly
----------------------------------------------

..
    *From GEOIPS#NN: 2024-03-XX, TODO*

Previously puilding the provided Dockerfile did not build a working image. It failed on the last step (installation of geoips) and hangs on installing rasterio. This fix updates the Dockerfile to install rasterio dependancies (``gdal-bin`` and ``libgdal-dev``) and additionally installs software-properties-common for access to add-apt-repository to aid in gdal installation.

::
    modified: Dockerfile

Remove inconsistent unit test test_log_interactive_non_geoips
-------------------------------------------------------------

The recently added ``test_log_interactive_non_geoips`` unit test is inconsistent. It
sometimes successfully raises an ``AttributeError`` but not always. This is due to
GeoIPS polluting the ``logging`` class when adding new logging levels. The polluted
``logging`` class does not appear to be a problem, though, since it adds functionality
without impacting existing functionality. It appears safe to allow this pollution.

Remove unnessesary checks for and mentions of imagemagick
---------------------------------------------------------
..
  *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#: YYYY-MM-DD, Removed unnecessary requirement for imagemagick*

In v1.11.3a0 imagemagick functionality was replaced with other libraries. As such,
imagemagick was no longder a dependancy. However, the installation docs, Dockerfile,
and setup scripts were not updated to reflect this change at the time. This fixes a
bug during installation where the user is forced to install imagemagick to pass tests
despite it no longer being used. It also updates the documentation accordingly.

Add make to expert installation dependencies
--------------------------------------------
..
  *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#454: 2024-03-15, Add make to expert installation dependencies*


`pypublicdecompwt` is a dependency of geoips. `make` is a dependency of `pypublicdecompwt`.
To install `pypublicdecompwt` you need `make`, but it's not listed as a dependency on
the expert installation instructions. It was added.

    modified: docs/source/starter/expert_installation.rst

Fix bad filename wrapping with log_with_emphasis
------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#468*

Fixes poor wrapping for long filenames when logged with emphasis. Now does not auto-wrap
long filenames and prints as is. Additionally, any word logged over 74 chars will not be 
broken.

Update log_with_emphasis to deal with empty strings
---------------------------------------------------

Previously, when calling log_with_emphasis(log, "test", "") an error is thrown.
This is a problem if you're logging out a message that ends with "" for any reason,
and log_with_emphasis has now been updated to gracefully deal with this case.

Refactor
========

Modify create_plugin_registries to use argparse
-----------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#416: 2023-12-21, Replace create_plugin_registries 'sys.argv' calls with 'argparse' library'*

Currently create_plugin_registries.py uses sys.argv calls to generate its arguments
rather than argparse. This doesn't follow GeoIPS conventions nor that of the CLI that
will soon be updated. We should replace these calls with argparse architecture, so that
this code follows current conventions, as does other GeoIPS code.

::

Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#429: 2024-02-02, Plugin Registries Should Be Readable*

Currently, the JSON output of the plugin registries is a hodge-podge full of text. We
should refactor the way in which these plugin registries are outputted, so that they are
in a human readable, interpretable format. To do so, we need to add the argument
``indent=4`` to the ``json.dump`` call in ``write_plugin_registries``.

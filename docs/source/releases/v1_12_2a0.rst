Bug Fixes
=========

Fix product sub-plugins duplicate source name error
---------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#428: 2024-2-6, source_name duplicate bug*

Currently, when the plugin registry is built, the key names associated with the
sub-products contained in a yaml file (for instance lets say smap-spd.yaml), are
gathered via the sub-products source name rather than the name of the product plugin
they reside in. In this case, all product plugins under the key name smap-spd, are
placed in that location because of their source name, not the attribute name, found
at the top level of smap-spd.yaml. This could cause issues with other products, as
found in issue *GEOIPS#423: 2024-1-17, create products for each possible product family*

This updates fixes this bug by changing the naming convention of product plugins stored
within the plugin registry. Instead of products -- <source_name> -- sub_product_name,
the keys are now formatted products -- <source_name>.<sub_product_name>, and duplicates
are checked on that level.

Testing Updates
===============

Create products for each possible product family handled by single_source procflow
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#423: 2024-1-17, Create products for each possible product family*

This update adds a new product ``all_product_families.yaml`` to the products interface.
This file provides every possible product family to test against ``single_source.py``
procflow plugin, as we need to understand which families work, and the process these
families follow throughout that code in order to implement a new procflow down the road,
called ``order_based.py`` procflow. By understanding the paths that these families take,
we set ourselves up for success in implementing that new procflow.

Files Added:

    added: geoips/plugins/yaml/products/all_product_families.yaml
    added: tests/scripts/order_based_all_product_families/*.sh

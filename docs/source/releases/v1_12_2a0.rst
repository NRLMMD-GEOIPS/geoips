Enhancements
============

Added Log with Emphasis function
--------------------------------

Scattered throughout GeoIPS (and other packages too), are many Log statements that use
'***********************...' to emphasize the content in between them. While this is
easy to see in the Log output, it's extremely cluttered in the actual code. For this
reason, I've added a 'log_with_emphasis' function to handle this. All you need to do now
is 'log_with_emphasis(LOG.<log_type>, message)', and it will do the rest for you.

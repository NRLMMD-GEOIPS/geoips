Refactor optional imports in readers to use context manager function
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#338: 2023-07-19, Clean up optional dependencies*

Some GeoIPS readers include optional dependency statements that are required to read
certain file formats. While keeping these imports as optional is ok, we should clean up
the manner in which this is implemented. To do so, we've created a separate
``geoips.testing.context_manager.py`` script which can handle optional imports scattered
throughout the GeoIPS codebase. This is essentially replacing our old manner of optional
dependencies with a new method that keeps things clean.

Testing Updates
===============

Move PyTest Validation from plugin_registry.py to Unit tests
------------------------------------------------------------
*From GEOIPS#426: 2024-02-02, GeoIPS won't run pip install . w/out [test] target*

GeoIPS currently fails to run if installed by simply calling ``pip install .``. It must,
instead, be installed with pip install .[test]. This is because pytest is used in
geoips/plugin_registry.py but is not included in the base GeoIPS installation
requirements.

To remediate this, we've since moved the pytest validation functionality off of the
PluginRegistry class itself, and moved it into unit tests at
``tests/unit_tests/plugin_registries/test_plugin_registries.py``, under class
PluginRegistryValidator. This removes the need for PyTest to be a GeoIPS dependency,
and is now a Unit Test dependency. If users want to validate their plugin registry, they
will have to manually install pytest to validate from now on.

Unit-Test validation of the plugin registry is performed to ensure it's in the correct
state. This was initially automatically done when it was created, but since it invoked
pytest and that's only a required dependency in the ``test`` extra, we have decided
to move this to a unit-test module so that end-users don't need to install pytest.
All in all, the user doesn't really need to validate their own registry. It
should not be created if an error occurs (eg. duplicate plugin names under the same
interface, poorly formatted plugin, etc.), however as developers we wanted the ability
to unit test the PluginRegistry to make sure everything was being done as expected.

Enhancements
============

Initial Stage of the GeoIPS CLI
-------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#37: 2022-08-11, Create a useful CLI for GeoIPS.*

GeoIPS currently runs off of a few command scripts scattered throughout the code. The
only way a user could discover this is by reading the documentation, or looking through
the pyproject.toml to discover what scripts/commands are executable at the commandline.

To fix this, we are beginning to implement a new GeoIPS CLI, which will be called via
``geoips <command> <sub-command>``. This will allow the user to easily query and/or
execute geoips without having extensive knowledge of the lower-level implementations of
GeoIPS.

Currently, the GeoIPS CLI implements config, get, list, run, and validate commands. We
expect that we will change how ``run`` works, as well as add additional commands such as
``test``.

You can find more detailed information about each command at
``geoips/geoips/commandline/ancillary_info/cmd_instructions.yaml``. Below, we'll detail
to a minimal extent what each command does.

``geoips config`` implements configuration commands which are used to modify and/or
set up your GeoIPS environment. Currently, we implement installation methods for
downloading and decompressing test datasets. This is called via
``geoips config install <test_dataset_name>``.

``geoips get`` implements a variety of commands which retrieve additional information
about GeoIPS artifacts. Artifacts are a high level term for software pieces implemented
throughout GeoIPS. This includes individual plugins, interfaces, families, and top-level
packages.

``geoips list`` implements a variety of list methods which are used to detail what
artifacts exist throughout the GeoIPS Environment, or at a package specific level. We
currently support listing an individual interface, available interfaces, implemented
interfaces in a certain/all package[s], packages, scripts, and test-datasets.

``geoips run`` is an easy way to run a certain test script contained within a GeoIPS
package. These scripts must be placed in the ``<pkg_name>/tests/scripts`` directory and
be implemented via a ``*.sh`` bash script. This is an easier method to run your test
scripts opposed to traversing to the explicit directory and running the bash script
manually. We expect this command will change greatly as we continue to develop the CLI
and implement the order based procflow.

``geoips test`` implements a few methods to run testing scattered throughout GeoIPS
and other GeoIPS packages. It functions similar to run, but instead of being limited
to just executing normal test scripts, we can also run integration tests, liniting,
and unit tests. Since we expect ``geoips run`` to change in the future, we've
implemented this command to execute testing protocols for the foreseeable future.

``geoips validate`` implements a simple method of validating a certain plugin found
at the specified filepath. We expect this command will do more in the future, but for
the meantime, this command will validate the plugin using the associated interface
defined in the aforementioned plugin.

For an example of how to run the GeoIPS CLI, see the code section below.
.. code-block:: bash

    # Install the test_data_clavrx Test Dataset from CIRA's Nextcloud Instance
    geoips config install test_data_clavrx
    # All Interfaces GeoIPS and other GeoIPS Packages will be listed including all of
    # The plugin names that exist in that type of interface
    geoips list interface algorithms
    # Retrieve the 'single_channel' algorithm plugin and output information related
    # to it
    geoips get plugin algorithms single_channel
    # Will run the script under <script_name>.sh as it would execute ./<script_name>.sh
    # run_procflow command in the corresponding tests/scripts directory
    geoips run geoips abi.static.Infrared.imagery_annotated.sh
    # Example of how to validate a specific plugin
    geoips validate /home/evan/geoips/geoips_packages/geoips/geoips/plugins/yaml/products/abi.yaml

Add function to list all available interfaces for each interface 'family'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#397: 2023-11-02, Add function to geoips.interfaces to list all interfaces of each type*

Added a function which lists all interfaces found for each interface family. Rather than
referring to a hard-coded list of interfaces that currently exist, we make assumptions
on the directory structure of the geoips package and list the corresponding interface
modules via the members of 'geoips.interfaces'.

::

    modified: geoips/interfaces/__init__.py

Documentation Scaffold for Coding Standards
-------------------------------------------
This update introduces a scaffold for the documentation of coding standards
for the project, aiming to ultimately enhance code consistency and quality. It
outlines the anticipated content and structure for these standards, providing
a clear framework for future contributions. The new documentation file is
located in the build/dev directory so that it is exempt from sphinx builds.


Added Log with Emphasis function
--------------------------------

Scattered throughout GeoIPS (and other packages too), are many Log statements that use
'***********************...' to emphasize the content in between them. While this is
easy to see in the Log output, it's extremely cluttered in the actual code. For this
reason, I've added a 'log_with_emphasis' function to handle this. All you need to do now
is 'log_with_emphasis(LOG.<log_type>, message)', and it will do the rest for you.

Introduced documentation for coding standards for module imports.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout GeoIPS, we have inconsistent module imports. These new standards (added to
our documentation) will help us be more intentional in how we import modules going
forward.

::
    modified: docs/dev/coding_standards.rst

Added documentation for current linters and configuration.
----------------------------------------------------------

GeoIPS makes use of a number of different linters and linter plugins. This
documentation lists and briefly describes each linter and gives configuration
information.

Bug Fixes
=========

Fix polar data not showing up in imagery
----------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#431: 2024-02-06, Look into polar projections in pyresample wrappers*

Currently products with polar projection sectors do not plot. Initial investigations
indicate pre-sectoring the data does not work well with data over the poles. It seems
passing ``--no-presectoring`` option at the command line helps - but there may be
additional issues with polar projections.

It was found that we are misinterpreting how pyresample's AreaDefinition attribute
``area_extent_ll`` is formulated. For polar sectors, when looking at such attribute,
it has been found that ``min_lat`` and ``max_lat`` values are extremely close to each
other, if not equal. While internally the AreaDefinition includes data from min_lat to
max_lat over the poles, we are interpretting those values as a line or a very small
swath, which usually misses some, if not all of the data you're attempting to plot.

We've added additional checks within ``geoips/xarray_utils/data.py`` --
``sector_xarray_spatial``, to modify the area_extent_ll to reflect the actual bounds
we want to include in our sectored data. While it may capture a greater area than
necessary, we fix the problem of missing data for polar imagery.

algorithm_interpolator_colormapper incorrectly interpolates data
----------------------------------------------------------------

This was found during the development for the GLM reader. Apparently, at line 1033 of
single_source.py procflow, when trying to interpolate data under the
algorithm_interpolator_colormapper family, we call 'interp_plugin' with the same
input and output xarray. This makes no sense, and needs to be fixed. It wasn't changing
the data in this format. To fix it, we leave input_xarray as 'alg_xarray', and set
output_xarray to 'None'. This is handled properly in the interpolator, and will modify
coordinate arrays to fit the shape of the interpolated data. I've checked config_based,
and this doesn't occur for that procflow.

::

    modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/procflows/single_source.py

Make add_log_level a callable class, ensure log.interactive works consistently
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Move addition of interactive log level into __init__*
*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Make add_log_level a callable class to fix AttributeErrors*

Remove call to ``add_log_level()`` from ``setup_logging()`` and into ``geoips/__init__.py``.
This makes ``log.interactive()`` available to all components of GeoIPS, regardless of how
they are accessed. Previously, if a plugin was used without the rest of GeoIPS (e.g. a
reader) it would raise an ``AttributeError`` if it called ``log.interactive()``.

This additionally makes add_log_level into a callable class called LogLevelAdder which must
be instantiated prior to use. This fixes a problem where AttributeErrors were raised from
time to time. The way that they occurred required them to be ignored, even when they were
useful. Now, only useful AttributeErrors should be raised.

Update Dockerfile to install rasterio properly
----------------------------------------------

..
    *From GEOIPS#NN: 2024-03-XX, TODO*

Previously building the provided Dockerfile did not build a working image.
It failed on the last step (installation of geoips) and hangs on installing rasterio.
This fix updates the Dockerfile to install rasterio dependancies (``gdal-bin`` and
``libgdal-dev``) and additionally installs software-properties-common for access to
add-apt-repository to aid in gdal installation.

::
    modified: Dockerfile

Remove inconsistent unit test test_log_interactive_non_geoips
-------------------------------------------------------------

The recently added ``test_log_interactive_non_geoips`` unit test is inconsistent. It
sometimes successfully raises an ``AttributeError`` but not always. This is due to
GeoIPS polluting the ``logging`` class when adding new logging levels. The polluted
``logging`` class does not appear to be a problem, though, since it adds functionality
without impacting existing functionality. It appears safe to allow this pollution.

::

    modified: tests/unit_tests/commandline/log_setup.py

Remove unnessesary checks for and mentions of imagemagick
---------------------------------------------------------
..
  *From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#: YYYY-MM-DD, Removed unnecessary requirement for imagemagick*

In v1.11.3a0 imagemagick functionality was replaced with other libraries. As such,
imagemagick was no longder a dependancy. However, the installation docs, Dockerfile,
and setup scripts were not updated to reflect this change at the time. This fixes a
bug during installation where the user is forced to install imagemagick to pass tests
despite it no longer being used. It also updates the documentation accordingly.

`pypublicdecompwt` is a dependency of geoips. `make` is a dependency of `pypublicdecompwt`.
To install `pypublicdecompwt` you need `make`, but it's not listed as a dependency on
the expert installation instructions. It was added.

::

    modified: docs/source/starter/expert_installation.rst

Fix bad filename wrapping with log_with_emphasis
------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#468*

Fixes poor wrapping for long filenames when logged with emphasis. Now does not auto-wrap
long filenames and prints as is. Additionally, any word logged over 74 chars will not be
broken.

Update log_with_emphasis to deal with empty strings
---------------------------------------------------

Previously, when calling log_with_emphasis(log, "test", "") an error is thrown.
This is a problem if you're logging out a message that ends with "" for any reason,
and log_with_emphasis has now been updated to gracefully deal with this case.

Refactor
========

Refactor optional imports in readers to use context manager function
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#338: 2023-07-19, Clean up optional dependencies*

Some GeoIPS readers include optional dependency statements that are required to read
certain file formats. While keeping these imports as optional is ok, we should clean up
the manner in which this is implemented. To do so, we've created a separate
``geoips.utils.context_managers.py`` script which can handle optional imports scattered
throughout the GeoIPS codebase. This is essentially replacing our old manner of optional
dependencies with a new method that keeps things clean.

Modify create_plugin_registries to use argparse
-----------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#416: 2023-12-21,
Replace create_plugin_registries 'sys.argv' calls with 'argparse' library'*

Currently create_plugin_registries.py uses sys.argv calls to generate its arguments
rather than argparse. This doesn't follow GeoIPS conventions nor that of the CLI that
will soon be updated. We should replace these calls with argparse architecture, so that
this code follows current conventions, as does other GeoIPS code.

::

    modified: geoips/geoips/create_plugin_registries.py

Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#429: 2024-02-02, Plugin Registries Should Be Readable*

Currently, the JSON output of the plugin registries is a hodge-podge full of text. We
should refactor the way in which these plugin registries are outputted, so that they are
in a human readable, interpretable format. To do so, we need to add the argument
``indent=4`` to the ``json.dump`` call in ``write_plugin_registries``.

Bug Fixes
=========

algorithm_interpolator_colormapper incorrectly interpolates data
----------------------------------------------------------------

This was found during the development for the GLM reader. Apparently, at line 1033 of
single_source.py procflow, when trying to interpolate data under the
algorithm_interpolator_colormapper family, we call 'interp_plugin' with the same
input and output xarray. This makes no sense, and needs to be fixed. It wasn't changing
the data in this format. To fix it, we leave input_xarray as 'alg_xarray', and set
output_xarray to 'None'. This is handled properly in the interpolator, and will modify
coordinate arrays to fit the shape of the interpolated data. I've checked config_based,
and this doesn't occur for that procflow.

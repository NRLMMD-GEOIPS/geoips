Testing Updates
===============

Move PyTest Validation from plugin_registry.py to Unit tests
------------------------------------------------------------
*From GEOIPS#426: 2024-02-02, GeoIPS won't run pip install . w/out [test] target*

GeoIPS currently fails to run if installed by simply calling ``pip install .``. It must,
instead, be installed with pip install .[test]. This is because pytest is used in
geoips/plugin_registry.py but is not included in the base GeoIPS installation
requirements.

To remediate this, we've since moved the pytest validation functionality off of the
PluginRegistry class itself, and moved it into unit tests at
``tests/unit_tests/plugin_registries/test_plugin_registries.py``, under class
PluginRegistryValidator. This removes the need for PyTest to be a GeoIPS dependency,
and is now a Unit Test dependency. If users want to validate their plugin registry, they
will have to manually install pytest to validate from now on.

Version 1.12.0 (2023-12-07)
***************************

* Bug fixes

  * Ensure that log.interactive works from plugins when imported independently

* Refactor

  * Update imports related to geoips database modules


Bug Fixes
=========

*From GEOIPS#446: 2024-02-21, Move addition of interactive log level into __init__*

Remove call to ``add_log_level()`` from ``setup_logging()`` and into ``geoips/__init__.py``.
This makes ``log.interactive()`` available to all components of GeoIPS, regardless of how
they are accessed. Previously, if a plugin was used without the rest of GeoIPS (e.g. a
reader) it would raise an ``AttributeError`` if it called ``log.interactive()``.

Refactor
========

Make JSON Plugin Registries Readable
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#429: 2024-02-02, Plugin Registries Should Be Readable*

Currently, the JSON output of the plugin registries is a hodge-podge full of text. We
should refactor the way in which these plugin registries are outputted, so that they are
in a human readable, interpretable format. To do so, we need to add the argument
``indent=4`` to the ``json.dump`` call in ``write_plugin_registries``.

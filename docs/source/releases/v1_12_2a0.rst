Enhancements
============

Began Developing the GeoIPS CLI
-------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#37: 2022-08-11, Create a useful CLI for GeoIPS.*

GeoIPS currently runs off of a few command scripts scattered throughout the code. The
only way a user could discover this is by reading the documentation, or looking through
the pyproject.toml to discover what scripts/commands are executable at the commandline.

To fix this, we are beginning to implement a new GeoIPS CLI, which will be called valid
``geoips <command> <sub-command>``. This will allow the user to easily query and/or
execute geoips without having extensive knowledge of the lower-level implementations of
GeoIPS.

.. code-block:: bash

    geoips list interfaces
    # All Interfaces GeoIPS and other GeoIPS Packages will be listed including all of
    # The plugin names that exist in that type of interface
    geoips run "<geoips_package_name> <script_name>.sh"
    # Will run the script under <script_name>.sh as it would execute ./<script_name>.sh
    # run_procflow command in the corresponding tests/scripts directory

Version 1.3.2 (2021-12-21)
**************************

v1.3.2: 2021-12-21, title\_format interface

Major New Functionality
=======================

* Create dev/title.py interface for alternative title formats

    * Add interface_modules/title_formats

        * tc_standard.py (existing default)
        * static_standard.py (existing default)
        * tc_copyright.py (currently for hy2)

    * Pass "title_format" to annotated imagery and windbarbs

        * imagery_annotated.py
        * imagery_windbarbs.pycam

Improvements
============

* Updated template pull request ticket: Testing Instructions, Summary, Output, Individual Commits
* Use dictionary of filename\_formats\_kwargs in YAML output configs rather than a single filename\_format\_kwarg

    * allows multiple filename_formats and specific kwargs for each

* Allow passing "title\_copyright" from command line or YAML output config for use in annotated imagery
* Added new DATABASESUCCESS and DATABASEFAILURE string checks to test\_all\_run.sh
* Note disk space, memory, and time required at the beginning of geoips base installation
* Use wget rather than curl for rclone setup for consistency
* satpy>=0.33.1, pyresample>=1.22.3 for future geostationary geolocation improvements
* Add "do\_not\_fail" option to repo update commands, to allow looping through all, and only updating those
    with the requested branch available (and not failing catastrophically on branches that don't exist)
* Use a single consolidated "plot\_data" function for both single source and overlay functionality

    * Set up bg_xarray, bg_data, bg_mpl_colors_info, and bg_product_name_title kwargs within config_based procflow

Bug fixes
=========

* Add rclone.conf file required for AWS ABI downloads
* Correctly replace \*\_URL environment variables within geoips paths

Refactoring Updates
===================

Applied Scope to CLI Arguments
------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#637: 2024-06-06, Using parser.parse_known_args in the CLI to apply scope to arguments*

While this PR ended up not making use of ``parse_known_args`` (It was buggy and
resulted in overly complex conditionals), we did end up finding a way to apply scope
(ie. share arguments from parents to children) to CLI commands to reduce repeated
portions of the code. This is also nice because we only have to make code changes to one
place if we want to alter arguments that are shared by various commands.

To do this, we created a ``ParentParsers`` Object in
``geoips.commandline.geoips_command`` which contains argument parsers that add arguments
which will be shared by some, if not all of the child command classes. For example, the
``geoips_parser`` attribute of ``ParentParsers`` will be shared to all child commands.
This is because every command is a child of ``geoips`` (the name of ``GeoipsCLI`` class).
A similar ideology applies to ``list_parser``, except that only children of ``list``,
ie. ``GeoipsListPackages``, ``GeoipsListPlugins``, etc. will get the arguments created
by ``list_parser``. This allows for us to share universal arguments such as log level
and command specific argumetns such as ``package_name``.

Bug Fixes
=========

Correct typo causing product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
to curr_products when output file list not defined.

This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
(followed a different route through the code for each).

Fix failing test data CLI unit tests
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. Fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the files that required changes.

Documentation Updates
=====================

Add pinkrst and brassy to dependencies
--------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#675: 2024-07-16, Add brassy and pinkrst to geoips lint dependencies*

::

  modified: pyproject.toml

Update LICENSE and DISTRIBUTION to latest approved version, update all file headers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

This file header should no longer have to change.

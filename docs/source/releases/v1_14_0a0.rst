Refactoring Updates
===================

Merged 'create_sector_image' into the CLI
-----------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#636: 2024-06-05, Merge create_sector_image.py functionality into the CLI*

This update moves the functionality from the independent console script
``create_sector_image`` onto the CLI under the command ``geoips test sector``. Since the
CLI has been added to main, we are slowly consolidating all independent console scripts
onto the CLI, so we have a uniform was of executing console commands with GeoIPS.

There was a slight modification to this command, as we now only allow one sector to
be provided to this command instead of a list of sectors. This fits better with the
nomenclature of the command and can be ran multiple times if the user wants to create
multiple sector images.

Unit tests have been added for this command as well.

Bug Fixes
=========

Correct typo causing product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
to curr_products when output file list not defined.

This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
(followed a different route through the code for each).

Fix failing test data CLI unit tests
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. Fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the files that required changes.

Documentation Updates
=====================

Add pinkrst and brassy to dependencies
--------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#675: 2024-07-16, Add brassy and pinkrst to geoips lint dependencies*

::

  modified: pyproject.toml

Update LICENSE and DISTRIBUTION to latest approved version, update all file headers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

This file header should no longer have to change.

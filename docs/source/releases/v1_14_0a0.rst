Fix failing test data CLI unit tests
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. Fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the files that required changes.

Bug Fixes
=========

Correct typo causing product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
to curr_products when output file list not defined.

This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
(followed a different route through the code for each).

Fix failing test data CLI unit tests
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. Fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the files that required changes.

Documentation Updates
=====================

Update LICENSE and DISTRIBUTION to latest approved version, update all file headers

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

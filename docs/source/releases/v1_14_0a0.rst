Final Bug Fixes for GeoIPS Workshop
-----------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

This branch fixes the remaining bugs that must be dealt with before the annual GeoIPS
Workshop commences. These bugs are largely unrelated to each other but need to be fixed
to ensure, installation, executing, and testing GeoIPS works without any hiccups. Please
add to this section below in the order in which the bugs are addressed.

1: Fixing failing unit tests so we can get the CI to pass. Unit tests
``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. We need to fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the changes made to get that working.

Correct typo causing product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
to curr_products when output file list not defined.

This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
(followed a different route through the code for each).

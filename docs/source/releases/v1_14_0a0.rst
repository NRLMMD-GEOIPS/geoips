Bug Fixes
=========

Correct typo causing product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
to curr_products when output file list not defined.

This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
(followed a different route through the code for each).

Fix failing test data CLI unit tests
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. Fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the files that required changes.

Rethink implementation of Plugin Registry Validation
----------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#526: 2024-04-29, Move test_interfaces out of geoips/commandline and into tests directory*

This stems from *GEOIPS#442: 2024-04-16, Move PyTest functionality from PluginRegistry Class to Unit Tests*,
which moved all pytest-dependent functions of the PluginRegistry class to a separate
unit test. We missed a reference to this validation in
``geoips/commandline/test_interfaces.py`` which ended up failing due to the moved
functions. We now invoke the ``import_optional_dependencies`` function in
``geoips/context_managers.py`` to implement this validation, and if the user does not
have pytest installed, we just don't validate the PluginRegistry and continue to
interface testing. We probably should discuss this a bit more, to see if we want to
refactor the unit tests to not use pytest for validation, or if it is fine leaving it
as-is.

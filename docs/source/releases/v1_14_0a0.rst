Refactoring Updates
===================

Applied Scope to CLI Arguments
------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#637: 2024-06-06, Using parser.parse_known_args in the CLI to apply scope to arguments*

While this PR ended up not making use of ``parse_known_args`` (It was buggy and
resulted in overly complex conditionals), we did end up finding a way to apply scope
(ie. share arguments from parents to children) to CLI commands to reduce repeated
portions of the code. This is also nice because we only have to make code changes to one
place if we want to alter arguments that are shared by various commands.

To do this, we created a ``ParentParsers`` Object in
``geoips.commandline.geoips_command`` which contains argument parsers that add arguments
which will be shared by some, if not all of the child command classes. For example, the
``geoips_parser`` attribute of ``ParentParsers`` will be shared to all child commands.
This is because every command is a child of ``geoips`` (the name of ``GeoipsCLI`` class).
A similar ideology applies to ``list_parser``, except that only children of ``list``,
ie. ``GeoipsListPackages``, ``GeoipsListPlugins``, etc. will get the arguments created
by ``list_parser``. This allows for us to share universal arguments such as log level
and command specific argumetns such as ``package_name``.

Bug Fixes
=========

Correct typo causing product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
to curr_products when output file list not defined.

This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
(followed a different route through the code for each).

Fix failing test data CLI unit tests
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. Fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the files that required changes.

Fix push of doclinttest-stable image to ghcr.io
-----------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#681: 2024-07-16, Fix push of doclinttest-stable image to ghcr.io*

Incorrect/old variables were being used in this step, but the issue wasn't
revealed until we pushed to main because the step didn't run except on main.
Added an additional step to also push doclinttest-latest in the same manner,
but from any branch to ensure that the doclinttest-stable step will succeed.

Documentation Updates
=====================

Add pinkrst and brassy to dependencies
--------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#675: 2024-07-16, Add brassy and pinkrst to geoips lint dependencies*

  modified: pyproject.toml

Update LICENSE and DISTRIBUTION to latest approved version, update all file headers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

This file header should no longer have to change.

Enhancements
============

Added 'expose' command
----------------------

*From GEOIPS#274: 2023-08-19, Add useage to setup.sh for command discovery*

The aforementioned issue requested that we add functionality to expose all commands
available in the GeoIPS environment. Rather than adding this functionality to setup.sh,
I've decided to add another function to geoips_utils.py which will expose all GeoIPS
commands in a tabular format. We expose available commands in a certain GeoIPS plugin
package to the terminal for easy perusal by the user. This will work for any new command
added in the future as well. This function adds one new dependency, ``tabulate``, though
``tabulate`` is added as a dependency to the CLI PRs anyways. We expect this might be
refactored into the CLI in a future PR.

To use this new function, reinstall GeoIPS via ``pip install -e .``, and run the command
``expose``.

This branch additionally includes a very small change made to two reader files and the
unit test for ``geoips validate`` as there were a couple of unit tests that could fail
due to relative imports used in a non-editable installed package.

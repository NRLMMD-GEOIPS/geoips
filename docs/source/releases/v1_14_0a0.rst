Bug Fixes
=========

Correct typo causing product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-16, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

Product families that did not have pre-defined output lists and expected data
passed unmodified from the readers to the output formatters were failing due to
a missing else statement ensuring the list of final_products was set even when
the output file list was not pre-defined.  Add else statement to set final_products
to curr_products when output file list not defined.

This resolved an error with product family xrdict_area_product_to_outlist when
it was requested without sectoring, but it worked if sectoring was requested
(followed a different route through the code for each).

Fix failing test data CLI unit tests
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. Fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the files that required changes.

Fix push of doclinttest-stable image to ghcr.io
-----------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#681: 2024-07-16, Fix push of doclinttest-stable image to ghcr.io*

Incorrect/old variables were being used in this step, but the issue wasn't
revealed until we pushed to main because the step didn't run except on main.
Added an additional step to also push doclinttest-latest in the same manner,
but from any branch to ensure that the doclinttest-stable step will succeed.

Update Geostationary readers to support multiple scan times
-----------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#312: Bug Fix: Update geostationary readers to support multiple scan times*

Geostationary readers previously could only handle one scan time per run through.
This is a limiting factor to these readers and one or more scientists at CIRA needed
these readers to be able to handle multiple scan times per use. We've made the
corresponding updates to geostaionary readers that were requested could read
multiple scan times. If this PR goes well, it might be a good idea to support this
functionality on other readers in the future.

Enhancements
============

Added 'expose' command
----------------------

*From GEOIPS#274: 2023-08-19, Add useage to setup.sh for command discovery*

The aforementioned issue requested that we add functionality to expose all commands
available in the GeoIPS environment. Rather than adding this functionality to setup.sh,
I've decided to add another function to geoips_utils.py which will expose all GeoIPS
commands in a tabular format. We expose available commands in a certain GeoIPS plugin
package to the terminal for easy perusal by the user. This will work for any new command
added in the future as well. This function adds one new dependency, ``tabulate``, though
``tabulate`` is added as a dependency to the CLI PRs anyways. We expect this might be
refactored into the CLI in a future PR.

To use this new function, reinstall GeoIPS via ``pip install -e .``, and run the command
``expose``.

This branch additionally includes a very small change made to two reader files and the
unit test for ``geoips validate`` as there were a couple of unit tests that could fail
due to relative imports used in a non-editable installed package.

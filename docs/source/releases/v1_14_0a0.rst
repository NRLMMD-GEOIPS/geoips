Refactoring Updates
===================

Merged 'create_sector_image' into the CLI
-----------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#636: 2024-06-05, Merge create_sector_image.py functionality into the CLI*

This update moves the functionality from the independent console script
``create_sector_image`` onto the CLI under the command ``geoips test sector``. Since the
CLI has been added to main, we are slowly consolidating all independent console scripts
onto the CLI, so we have a uniform was of executing console commands with GeoIPS.

There was a slight modification to this command, as we now only allow one sector to
be provided to this command instead of a list of sectors. This fits better with the
nomenclature of the command and can be ran multiple times if the user wants to create
multiple sector images.

Unit tests have been added for this command as well.

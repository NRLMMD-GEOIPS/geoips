Bug Fixes
=========

Fix failing test data CLI unit tests
------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#666: 2024-07-14, Final Bug Fixes Prior to Workshop*

``test_geoips_config_install.py`` and ``test_log_setup.py`` had 1 or more tests that
were failing, which caused the CI to fail as well. Fix these unit tests so
we can actually use the CI to address problems that are coming from new PRs. Below are
the files that required changes.

    modified: tests/unit_tests/commandline/test_log_setup.py
    modified: tests/unit_tests/commandline/cli_top_level_tester.py
    deleted: tests/unit_tests/commandline/test_geoips_config_install.py

Fix push of doclinttest-stable image to ghcr.io
-----------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#681: 2024-07-16, Fix push of doclinttest-stable image to ghcr.io*

Incorrect/old variables were being used in this step, but the issue wasn't
revealed until we pushed to main because the step didn't run except on main.
Added an additional step to also push doclinttest-latest in the same manner,
but from any branch to ensure that the doclinttest-stable step will succeed.

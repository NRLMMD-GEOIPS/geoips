===================

Applied Scope to CLI Arguments
------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#637: 2024-06-06, Using parser.parse_known_args in the CLI to apply scope to arguments*

While this PR ended up not making use of ``parse_known_args`` (It was buggy and
resulted in overly complex conditionals), we did end up finding a way to apply scope
(ie. share arguments from parents to children) to CLI commands to reduce repeated
portions of the code. This is also nice because we only have to make code changes to one
place if we want to alter arguments that are shared by various commands.

To do this, we created a ``ParentParsers`` Object in
``geoips.commandline.geoips_command`` which contains argument parsers that add arguments
which will be shared by some, if not all of the child command classes. For example, the
``geoips_parser`` attribute of ``ParentParsers`` will be shared to all child commands.
This is because every command is a child of ``geoips`` (the name of ``GeoipsCLI`` class).
A similar ideology applies to ``list_parser``, except that only children of ``list``,
ie. ``GeoipsListPackages``, ``GeoipsListPlugins``, etc. will get the arguments created
by ``list_parser``. This allows for us to share universal arguments such as log level
and command specific argumetns such as ``package_name``.

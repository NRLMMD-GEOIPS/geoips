Version 1.4.2 (2022-02-05)
**************************

v1.4.2: 2022-02-05, finalizing procflows to allow unprojected outputs, updating test outputs for consistent shapefiles

Test Repo Updates
=================

* Updated to Natural Earth Vector v5.0.0 shapefiles

    * AMSR2 TC image - very slightly modified political boundaries
    * AHI global image - very slightly modified political boundaries

Major New Functionality
=======================

* SAR Incident Angle Product

    * Added "incident\_angle" variable to SAR xarray output
    * Added "incident-angle" product to "sar-spd" product\_inputs
    * Added "incident-angle" YAML product\_params, and test script

* ASCAT UHR windbarbs test script
* "unprojected\_image" output\_format module

    * Plots the data with no resampling - no area\_def required
    * Call signature: xarray\_obj, product\_name, output\_fnames, product\_name\_title=None, mpl\_colors\_info=None 
                      x\_size=None, y\_size=None

* "unprojected" outputter\_type

    * Call signature: xarray\_obj, product\_name, output\_fnames, product\_name\_title=None, mpl\_colors\_info=None 

* Support <DATASET>:<VARNAME> variable requests in product\_inputs YAML config files

    * Update VIIRS Night-Visible to use DNB:SunZenith
    * Update VIIRS Visible to use MOD:Sunzenith
    * Update AHI Visible to use MED:Sunzenith

* Added noaa-20 platform to amsub\_mirs reader
* Filter "poor" quality data within SMOS reader

    * previously was saving poor, fair, and good

Improvements
============

* Installation Improvements

    * Allow skipping installation steps, rather than just continuing or quitting altogether
    * Separate steps for downloading cartopy map data and linking to ~/.local
    * Separate rclone, seviri, and vim8 installation steps (to allow skipping one or more if not needed)

* Updated command line arguments

    * sectored\_read / resampled\_read - specifications for primary dataset

        * Determines whether to read data initially or within area\_def loop

    * self\_register\_dataset, self\_register\_source, and self\_register\_platform

        * Explicitly request using specific dataset lat/lons as the area\_def target for resampling
        * Add self\_register area\_def specification in get\_area\_defs\_from\_commandline\_args

    * fuse\_sectored\_read / fuse\_resampled\_read - specifications for additional datasets
    * fuse\_self\_register\_dataset, fuse\_self\_register\_source, fuse\_self\_register\_platform

* Updated procflow ordering

    * Tunable data read order within procflows (based on data read requirements)

        * For self\_register or reader\_defined area\_defs - must read data prior to calling
            get\_area\_defs\_from\_commandline\_args (so area information is available within the xarray
            dataset when identifying area\_defs)
        * For externally specified area\_defs, read data after calling get\_area\_defs\_from\_commandline\_args,
            to reduce processing time if there is no coverage
        * For sectored\_read / resampled\_read data types, do not read data until we are within the area\_defs loop

    * Tunable algorithm order within procflows (based on alg\_type specified in dev/alg.py)

        * Support alg\_cmap and alg\_interp\_cmap algorithm types (previously only interp\_alg\_cmap supported -
            allow calling algorithm prior to data interpolation)

    * Tunable sectoring order within procflows (based on data read requirements)

        * Do not sector reader\_defined or self\_register sector types - must use full dataset, no padding available

    * Tunable outputter\_types within procflows (variable call signatures)

        * xarray\_data
        * image
        * image\_overlay
        * unprojected\_image

* Add mem\_usg and process\_times output to procflows for monitoring

Bug fixes
=========

* Update pmw\_37 and windbarbs algorithms to only include mandatory "arrays" argument, make output\_data\_range optional

    * If None, output\_data\_range will default to 230 to 280 for 37pct, and data min/max for windbarbs.

* Update single\_source procflow to ensure "resampled\_read" is passed to get\_alg\_xarray

    * to allow using the resampled dataset for retrieving the requested variables
    * if \<DATASET\_NAME>:\<VARIABLE\_NAME> construct used in product\_inputs YAML configs,
        we must assure resampled data is not limited to the native datasets,
        since they will no longer exist

bug fix:
- title: 'Add site-nrlmmd-geoips option to interactive pytest'
  description: |
    This should be all encompassing for everything required to test a complete
    github.com NRLMMD-GEOIPS installation. This includes all integration tests, as
    well as all short and long pytests.

    Additionally, ensure markers are passed properly to the pytest command from
    within interactive_pytest.sh - we can't include the quotes in the
    pytest_marker_arg variable, so include ONLY the markers in pytest_marker_arg,
    and include the -m within the actual call to pytest.

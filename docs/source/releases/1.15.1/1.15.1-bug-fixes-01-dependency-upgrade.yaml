bug fixes:
  - title: "Replace xarray_datatree with xarray"
    description: |
      DataTree class has now been integrated with xarray, no longer require separate
      xarray_datatree dependency, and now import DataTree from xarray rather than
      datatree.

  - title: "numpy 2.0/netcdf 1.7 bug fixes for AMI reader, seg faults and dtypes"
    description: |
      Upgrade to numpy 2.0 and netcdf 1.7 requires 3 fixes to AMI reader

      1. Ensure all netcdf files are closed to avoid seg fault (open with with)
      2. Cast lons returned from pyresample.utils.wrap_longitudes back to
         lats.dtype, to ensure lats and lons array dtypes match when passed
         to SwathDefinition.
      3. Cast number of lines and number of samples returned from netcdf datafile
         to np.int64, rather than the returned np.int32. np.int32 shape when
         passed to numpy.memmap caused an overflow (required np.int64)

  - title: "numpy 2.0 un-bug fixes for SMAP reader"
    description: |
      Upgrade to numpy 2.0 originally had a bug causing SMAP reader to fail
      when adding / manipulating masked datetime64 arrays.  We had a hack in
      place that actually did not work anyway, and as of 2.2.4 the datetime64
      bug was resolved in numpy 2.x.

      Added a note to pyproject.toml saying numpy 2.x broke masked datetime64
      arrays, and it was fixed by 2.2.4.

  - title: "xarray > 2024.3.0 bug fix for SCAT NOAA NetCDF reader"
    description: |
      We had a fix in place for the SCAT NOAA NetCDF reader to function with
      xarray < 2022.06 (if xarray has ufuncs, then use it), because xarray
      removed the "ufuncs" method in 2022.06.  That block of code was untested
      for a while, then as of 2025.3.1 ufuncs was back! But there was a
      typo in the fix.  We were only setting xarray["rain_flag"] in the ufuncs
      option for xarray with ufuncs, and not the "rf" variable.  The "rf"
      variable is what was being used downstream for setting ambiguities.
      Set rf = wind_xarray["rain_flag"] in the ufuncs block.

  - title: "matplotlib 3.10 image updates using interpolation_stage data"
    description: |
      Minor imagery changes due to matplotlib 3.10 upgrade, with interpolation_stage
      set to "data" for backwards compatibility with matplotlib 3.9 for most output
      images.  Note an additional round of image updates will be required for 3.10
      update with interpolation set to "none", which is going to be our final
      configuration since we do our own interpolation prior to plotting, and matplotlib
      interpolation is unnecessary.

      interpolation_stage="data" made most output images match between 3.9 and 3.10,
      but there were still a few that had slight differences.

      * windbarb products had very slight differences at the edges of some barbs
        (maybe 10% of the barbs had differences)
      * AMI unprojected image had edge of scan changes (bright red difference
        line around the full edge of scan)
      * AMI annotated image had very small differences within the image (a few
        red pixels in the diff image), and significant differences in the title)

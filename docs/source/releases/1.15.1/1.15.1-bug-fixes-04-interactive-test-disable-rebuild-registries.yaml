  - title: "Create interactive_test.sh integration test script"
    description: |
      Actual integration tests are now called via pytest with specific markers
      (full and integration for full test, base and integration for base test).
      Create a single "interactive_test" script that can be called with either a
      "full_test" or "base_test" argument that will call the pytest command
      appropriately from the command line, and redirect the output to
      $GEOIPS_OUTDIRS/logs/pytest/full_test or base_test.  This allows easily
      running integration tests from the command line, and tracking the output for
      later perusal.  This may be replaced with pytest arguments in the future for
      storing the full output, but for now just redirect the full output to a log file.
      We will likely want to always maintain an "interactive_test.sh" script that
      calls the pytest-based integration tests appropriately, and tracks the output
      appropriately.

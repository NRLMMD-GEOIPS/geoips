bug fix:
- title: 'CLI geoips run -h bug fix'
  description: |
    There was an oversight in the command
    geoips.commandline.commandline_interface:support_legacy_procflows which has a set
    of hardcoded, valid procflows that can be ran. Since this code is hit before the
    argparser is actually initalized (needs to be for the time being, until OBP is out),
    the check against vaild procflows would fail if the command 'geoips run -h' was
    ran, as '-h' is not a valid procflow. This PR updates that logic to allow for '-h'
    to be passed in that format, and adds that as a unit test.

Bug fixes
=========

Make sechma, validators, and registries properties in interface classes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To improve load times, the schema, validators, and registries were updated
to be properties in the Interface classes.

::

  modified: geoips/interfaces/bases.py

Set paths in check_code.sh with pwd
-----------------------------------

To avoid relative paths (which causes incorrect pkgname in check_code.sh),
when setting paths at the beginning, use the cd dirname $0 && pwd construct.
(ie, change to the directory in a subshell, then pwd it to set the path)

Skip geoips pytests when GEOIPS_DISABLE_SHARED_CODE_CHECKS=True
---------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-15, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

geoips pytests and test_interfaces both test ALL plugin packages by default
every time.  Setting GEOIPS_DISABLE_SHARED_CODE_CHECKS allows not running
those shared tests with every test run.

Initially only test_interfaces was skipped when GEOIPS_DISABLE_SHARED_CODE_CHECKS
was set, expand to also skip geoips pytests.

Additionally add export statements before and after geoips check_code in
full_test.sh, so all tests are run for geoips check_code.sh, and shared
code checks are skipped for subsequenty plugin packages check_code.sh calls.
And remove the direct "test_interfaces" call from full_test.sh (since it
is now called from check_code.sh)

Add registered_plugins.json to .gitignore
-----------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-15, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

This is auto-generated at build time, ignore.

Return empty list from get_plugins for interfaces with no plugins
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-15, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

All plugin interfaces are explicitly imported in
geoips/interfaces/__init__.py, and test_interfaces
uses that list of available interfaces for looping through
and testing all of the interfaces.

The get_plugins() method within interfaces/base.py checks for a
self.name entry within the registered_plugins dictionary when
finding the list of all plugins.

self.name comes explicitly from one of the interfaces that are
found by default on geoips.interfaces.

If there is a defined interface with no plugins available in the current
geoips installation (in any currently installed plugin package),
then there will NOT be an entry within registered plugins
for that interface, and a KeyError will be raised in the for loop.

Now, within get_plugins(), we check if the current interface
(self.name) is found in the registered_plugins dictionary -
if it is not, that means there are no plugins for that interface,
so we return an empty list.

::

  geoips/interfaces/base.py


Leave product_defaults-defined attributes as null in registry
-------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-15, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

When assembling the plugin registry, family and docstring can both
be defined within the "product_defaults" rather than directly in the
current product. Since product_defaults can be defined in ANY plugin
package, we are not guaranteed to have the product defaults definition
available when assembling the current product's registry.

For now, when product_defaults is defined, and family and docstring are not,
just leave family and docstring as "null" in the registry.  We can pull
the family and docstring from the plugins themselves at runtime.

If we determine it is an efficiency hit in the future, we could potentially
set up create_plugin_registries.py to do a second pass after all plugin
registries are populated to fill in the nulls, but for now we will
allow them to be populated at runtime or with the CLI.

Additionally, if family or docstring are NOT defined on the sub-plugin,
and product_defaults is also NOT defined, raise an error.  If no product
defaults are defined, then there will be nowhere to pull the required
family and docstring attributes if they are not defined explicitly,
so that will always be an error. Most likely this would be covered
by the schema, but provide another check here prior to creating the
registries.

Do not fail at runtime for missing plugin registries
----------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-15, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

If an installed package does not have a plugin registry json file,
do not catastrophically fail at runtime.

test_interfaces still fails for a missing plugin registry file,
so it will be caught in testing, just do not fail catastrophically
at runtime until the plugin registry is actually required.

::

  # test script:
  15_070045 plugin_registry.py:95     ERROR: Plugin registry
  $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/recenter_tc/recenter_tc/registered_plugins.json did not exist,

Remove explicit includes from plugin_extend.rst
-----------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-15, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

An explicit range of lines was initially being included in all plugin
development RST files from plugin_extend.rst.
This was causing a duplicate label error when including
the same sphinx label in all of the plugin_development RST files.

To avoid future errors, if the contents of plugin_extend.rst
is changed in the future, added a reference link within plugin_extend.rst
to the required attributes, and linked to that from each plugin development
RST file (rather than including a specific set of lines verbatim).

Collect all plugin registry errors and report and fail at end
-------------------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-09, update 'update_this_release_note'*

Rather than having to fix a single bad plugin at a time when attempting
to create the plugin registry, wait until all have been read in,
and raise an error at the very end including the error messages from
each of the bad plugins.

Updated output (includes all bad plugins at once, instead of one at a time).

Fix for duplicate entry points for setuptools pip install -e
------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-11, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

It appears when there is a .egg-info directory in a plugin package directory,
that plugin package gets picked up twice in the entry points.  Rather than
filtering the list every time the entry points are opened in geoips_utils.py,
just filter once when creating the plugin registries.

I believe this is a Python 3.9 bug with entry points, causing the duplicate
packages when installed with setuptools.  3.10 appears to resolve the
duplicates.

Do not catastrophically fail at runtime for a single bad plugin
---------------------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-11, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

Remove validate_registry calls from within the PluginRegistry init. allow
using the registry if some values are bad.

Add test for validate_registry and validate_all_registries to test_interfaces.
Everything in test_interfaces should be moved to unit tests at some point.

This ensures all plugins within the registry are valid, but avoids
failing catastrophically during runtime for a single bad plugin if
it were validated every time at runtime.

Add interface level to ascii_palettes plugin registry
-----------------------------------------------------

*From GEOIPS#393: 2023-11-10, 1.11.7 merge bug fixes*

Currently pull interface name from final directory in path, and plugin name
from file basename.

Eventually we will include this information directly in the text files themselves
(so they are fully fledged plugins), but for now to ensure consistent/correct
formatting within the plugin registries, ensure we have an interface level
for txt plugins.

Additionally, add in interface/family/name fields to existing ascii palettes.
Unused for now, but included for reference.

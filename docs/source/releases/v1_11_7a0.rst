Bug Fixes
=========

Fix Upside Down Geotiff Error
-----------------------------

Geotiffs created by GeoIPS are upside down when imported into other applications, such
as Google Earth. We need to fix this so users aren't confused

Documentation Updates
=====================

Add Links Throughout GeoIPS Documentation
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#322: 2023-09-14, Add Links Throught GeoIPS Sphinx Documentation*

Links in much of the GeoIPS documentation were relative paths to RST files within
the docs/source directory.  This does not work within sphinx-built html documentation.
All relative path links updated to valid sphinx ref links.

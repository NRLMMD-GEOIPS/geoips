Bug Fixes
=========

Fix Upside Down Geotiff Error
-----------------------------

Geotiffs created by GeoIPS are upside down when imported into other applications, such
as Google Earth. We need to fix this so users aren't confused

Fixed from scipy.ndimage.interpolation import zoom deprecation warning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The scipy.ndimage.interpolation library was deprecated as of scipy v1.2 (Dec 2018), 
and was causing warnings when importing the zoom libary for the ahi_hsd reader and
the abi_netcdf reader.

The following files have been modified to remove those deprecation warnings.

Added dictionary xarray to datatree conversion

Documentation Updates
=====================

Add Links Throughout GeoIPS Documentation
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#322: 2023-09-14, Add Links Throught GeoIPS Sphinx Documentation*

Links in much of the GeoIPS documentation were relative paths to RST files within
the docs/source directory.  This does not work within sphinx-built html documentation.
All relative path links updated to valid sphinx ref links.

Files Modified:

Add windows installation instructions

  modified: README.md

Refactoring Updates
===================

Rename Geostationary Sectors
----------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#304: 2023-08-27, Rename Geostationary Sectors*

Currently, GeoIPS has sectors that need to be renamed, so they are more informative.
This includes goes16, goes17, and himawari8. We also should add additional Geostationary
sectors, such as meteosat-europe, meteosat-africa, and meteosat-indian-ocean. This will
require changes to the output products as well.

*****************************

* Added documentation for windows installation
* Fix Upside Down Geotiff Error
* Add sphinx reference links throughout geoIPS documentation

Enhancements
============

Create "output_checkers" interface
----------------------------------

Refactor "compare_outputs.py" python module into an "output_checkers" interface,
and split into multiple plugins for different product types.

Create "image_compare_threshold" commandline argument
-----------------------------------------------------

With the addition of output_checkers, we decided we would also like to have flexibility
with our pixel comparisons. Specifically, we'd like to have the ability to adjust the
"threshold" (% difference between pixels), for different user needs. This update adds
three threshold values ["lenient" (10%), "medium" (5%), "strict" (0%)].

Bug Fixes
=========

Fix Upside Down Geotiff Error
-----------------------------

Geotiffs created by GeoIPS are upside down when imported into other applications, such
as Google Earth. We need to fix this so users aren't confused

Fixed from scipy.ndimage.interpolation import zoom deprecation warning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The scipy.ndimage.interpolation library was deprecated as of scipy v1.2 (Dec 2018), 
and was causing warnings when importing the zoom libary for the ahi_hsd reader and
the abi_netcdf reader.

The following files have been modified to remove those deprecation warnings.

Documentation Updates
=====================

Add Links Throughout GeoIPS Documentation
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#322: 2023-09-14, Add Links Throught GeoIPS Sphinx Documentation*

Links in much of the GeoIPS documentation were relative paths to RST files within
the docs/source directory.  This does not work within sphinx-built html documentation.
All relative path links updated to valid sphinx ref links.

    docs/source/starter/windows_installation.rst
    docs/source/starter/extending.rst

Add windows installation instructions
-------------------------------------

::

  new: docs/source/starter/windows_installation.rst
  modified: README.md

Refactoring Updates
===================

Convert base.py: plugin_module_to_obj to class-based method
-----------------------------------------------------------

Currently, base.py: plugin_module_to_obj is a standalone function in interfaces/base.py,
which causes unneccesary confusion and should be converted to a class-based function
under BaseModuleInterface. This follows the convention of plugin_yaml_to_obj under
BaseYamlInterface, which is a much better implementation.

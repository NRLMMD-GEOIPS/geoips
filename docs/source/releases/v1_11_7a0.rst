Bug Fixes
=========

Fixed from scipy.ndimage.interpolation import zoom deprecation warning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The scipy.ndimage.interpolation library was deprecated as of scipy v1.2 (Dec 2018), 
and was causing warnings when importing the zoom libary for the ahi_hsd reader and
the abi_netcdf reader.

The following files have been modified to remove those deprecation warnings.

    * modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/readers/abi_netcdf.py
    * modified: geoips/geoips/plugins/modules/readers/ahi_hsd.py

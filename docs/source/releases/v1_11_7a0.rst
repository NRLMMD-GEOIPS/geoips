Documentation Updates
=====================

Add Links Throughout GeoIPS Documentation
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#322: 2023-09-14, Add Links Throught GeoIPS Sphinx Documentation*

Links in much of the GeoIPS documentation were relative paths to RST files within
the docs/source directory.  This does not work within sphinx-built html documentation.
All relative path links updated to valid sphinx ref links.

Refactoring Updates
===================

Convert base.py: plugin_module_to_obj to class-based method
-----------------------------------------------------------

Currently, base.py: plugin_module_to_obj is a standalone function in interfaces/base.py,
which causes unneccesary confusion and should be converted to a class-based function
under BaseModuleInterface. This follows the convention of plugin_yaml_to_obj under
BaseYamlInterface, which is a much better implementation.

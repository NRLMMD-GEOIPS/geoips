Version 1.11.7a0 (2023-10-05)
*****************************

* Added documentation for windows installation
* Add create_plugin_registry.py to avoid loading all YAML plugins during run_procflow.

Efficiency Improvements
=======================

Changed how run_procflow accesses plugins, by creating a plugin registry
------------------------------------------------------------------------

From NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#238: 2023-07-06

Currently, when run_procflow is called, GeoIPS actually has to load in every
existing GeoIPS plugin to find the appropriate plugin. This is very inefficient
and was resulting in 15+ seconds of lag time before run_procflow would actually
run. To fix this, we have created a plugin registry, which is essentially a python
dictionary of all the available plugins. This is now used to select the appropriate
plugin when run_procflow is called.

To do this, these files were added:

::

    added: geoips/geoips/create_plugin_registry.py

When the file above is called, it generates a file in the same directory called
"registered_plugins.py". This is the plugin dictionary which run_procflow selects from.
With this new plugin registry implementation, certain changes were required to get
this functionality to work. This includes:

::

    modified: geoips/geoips/geoips_utils.py (load_all_yaml_plugins())
    modified: geoips/geoips/interfaces/base.py (_create_unvalidated_plugins_cache())

Documentation Updates

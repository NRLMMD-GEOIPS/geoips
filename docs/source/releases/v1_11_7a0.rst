Documentation Updates
=====================

Add Links Throughout GeoIPS Documentation
-----------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#322: 2023-09-14, Add Links Throught GeoIPS Sphinx Documentation*

Links in much of the GeoIPS documentation were relative paths to RST files within
the docs/source directory.  This does not work within sphinx-built html documentation.
All relative path links updated to valid sphinx ref links.

Refactoring Updates
===================

Rename Geostationary Sectors
----------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#304: 2023-08-27, Rename Geostationary Sectors*

Currently, GeoIPS has sectors that need to be renamed, so they are more informative.
This includes goes16, goes17, and himawari8. We also should add additional Geostationary
sectors, such as meteosat-europe, meteosat-africa, and meteosat-indian-ocean. This will
require changes to the output products as well.

    * list_available_modules
    * test_interfaces

Major New Functionality
=======================

* Add hscat hy-2b and hy-2c processing

    * windspeed
    * windbarbs
    * unsectored text
    * sectored text

* Add test script to test all dev and stable interfaces

    * list_available_modules
    * test_interfaces

* imagery_windbarbs_clean output_format
* output_format_kwargs and filename_format_kwargs options in YAML output config and command line

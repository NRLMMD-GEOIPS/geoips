Extend GeoIPS with Plugins
**************************

GeoIPS is almost entirely composed of plugins and can be extended by developing
new plugins in external python packages. The ability to extend GeoIPS using
plugins means that there is no need to edit the main GeoIPS code to add new
functionality.  Most types of functionality in GeoIPS can be extended. If you
encounter something that you would like to be able to extend but are unable to,
please contact the GeoIPS team or create an issue on GitHub.

Developing a new plugin for GeoIPS requires developing a new Python package
that GeoIPS erms a "plugin package". The plugin package can contain one or
more plugins. It is configured in a special way such that, when it is
installed, it registers itself and its plugins with GeoIPS.

An example repository `Template Basic Plugin <https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/template_basic_plugin/tree/main>`_
is provided that can guide you through the process of creating a new plugin
package containing one or more custom plugins.

GeoIPS Plugin Vocabulary
========================

Plugin
------
A GeoIPS plugin may be either a Python module or a YAML file that extends
GeoIPS with new functionality. The type (Python module / YMAL) of
the product plugin is determined by its interface.

Plugins are stored in installable Python packages that register their payload with
GeoIPS through the use of
`entrypoints <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/>`_.

Module-based Plugin
-------------------
A module-based plugin extends GeoIPS by adding new functionality capable of
performing specific actions, such as applying an algorithm, read data, or
formatting outputs. These plugins are defined as a single python modules
containing a few required top-level variables and a function that executes the
plugin's action. Examples of module-based plugins include ``algorithms``,
``readers``, and various types of formatters.

YAML-based Plugin
-----------------
A YAML-based plugin extends GeoIPS by adding a new set of static configuration
options for GeoIPS.  Examples of YAML-based plugins include
``sectors``, ``products``, and ``feature-annotators``.

.. _required-attributes:


Plugin Attributes:
------------------

The following are the top-level plugin attributes. Any required attribute will
be explicitly stated.

#. Interface

   **Required.** An ``interface`` defines a class of GeoIPS plugins that extend
   the same type of functionality within GeoIPS. For example, some commonly
   used interfaces include the ``algorithms``, ``colormappers``, and
   ``sectors`` interfaces.

#. Family (Required)

   **Required.** A ``family`` is a subset of an interface's plugins which
   accept specific sets of arguments/properties. Module-based plugins of the
   same ``family`` have similar call signatures. YAML-based plugins of the same
   ``family`` are validated against the same schema (i.e. they contain the same
   properties).

#. Docstring (Required)

   **Required.** A ``docstring`` is a block of documentation that describes a
   plugin's functionality. It is required for all GeoIPS plugins, whether
   module-based or YAML-based, to ensure proper documentation.

************************************

Setting up WSL through windows is the easiest method for running GeoIPS on
a Windows system.

Complete Local WSL-based GeoIPS Installation
==============================================

The following instructions will guide you through installing GeoIPS using
WSL and the linux based installation. This installation allows for a simple 
workaround of the normally difficult windows installation.

1. Setup WSL 
-----------------------------------

Follow directions on
`Microsoft WSL Install <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_ 
which installs WSL2 and Unbuntu by default.
Note, this does require adminstrator privileges on 
the windows machine.

After a successful install and setup, run wsl and use the Linux installation
guide for installing geoips and the required Python environment:

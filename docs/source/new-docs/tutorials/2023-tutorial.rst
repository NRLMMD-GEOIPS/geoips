2023 Tutorial
=============

Assigned to: Kumar
Due for review: June 3rd

Done looks like:
 - Work done on a feature branch, eg. documentation-2023-tutorial
 - Readable and followable, please use a grammar checker + spell checker
 - Passes doc8 checks, see the `sphinx RST Primer
   <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#restructuredtext-primer>`_`
   and checkout this tool I wrote for auto-formatting RST files:
   `pink <https://github.com/biosafetylvl5/pinkrst/tree/main>`_

   - Does NOT include

     - New tutorial components
     - Information on how GeoIPS works, this is "how to bake a pie", not "what is a pie".
       For more information, please
       read `this primer on tutorials <https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/tutorials/>`

   - Does include

     - All of the information from the 2023 tutorial
     - Edits where nessesary if GeoIPS functionality has changed since 2023

 - A PR from your feature branch to ``main`` ðŸ˜Š

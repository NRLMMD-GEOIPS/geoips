****************************************
New Product Creation by Extending GeoIPS 
****************************************

This section elaborates on product creation using GeoIPS. We will create three products using CLAVR-x data namely
Cloud-Top-Height, Cloud-Base-Height, and Cloud-Depth. Products are the cornerstone
plugin for GeoIPS, as they define how to produce a specific product as a combination of
other plugins. Products use other plugins, such as an algorithm, colormapper,
interpolater, etc. to generate the intended output.

We are now going to dive into hands-on experience by creating a product for CLAVR-x Cloud-Top-Height:

#. Navigate to your Product Plugins Directory
   ::

        cd $MY_PKG_DIR/$MY_PKG_NAME/plugins/yaml/products

   .. NOTE::
    If you're not able to move into the directory listed in the above code-block. Verify if the values of
    environment variables are set as needed.

    .. code-block:: shell

      echo $MY_PKG_NAME : reflects your package name directory

      echo $MY_PKG_DIR  : reflects merged path of $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/$MY_PKG_NAME

#. Now, create a file called ``my_clavrx_products.yaml`` and add the following code into it 

   .. code-block:: yaml

      interface: products
      family: list
      name: my_clavrx_products
      docstring: |
           CLAVR-x imagery products

   The code snippet shown above shows properties required in every GeoIPS plugin, YAML-based or
   Module-based. These properties help GeoIPS understand the type of plugin you are developing
   and also defines the schema your plugin will be validated against.

   It is recommended to go through the definitions of the top level attributes such as ``interface``,
   ``family``, and ``docstring`` that are required in any GeoIPS plugin. 
   Click here
   :ref:`click here <required-attributes>` 
   (page opens in the same window) to go the related documentation. 

#. Now we'll add the ``spec`` portion to the yaml file created in the last step to support our new product plugin.
   ``spec`` is a container for the 'specification' of your yaml plugin. In this case, it
   contains a list of ``products``, as shown below. Denoted by the ``family: list``
   property shown above, this yaml file will contain a list of products, which can be of
   length 1 if you so desire.

   Append the code below at the end of yaml file, under the docstring you wrote, with no tabs behind it. YAML is a whitespace-based
   coding language, similar to Python in that aspect. 

   .. code-block:: yaml

    spec:
      products:
        - name: My-Cloud-Top-Height      # name of the product you're defining 
          source_names: [clavrx]         # defined as metadata in the corresponding reader
          docstring: |                   # Pipe says to YAML this will be a multiline comment 
            CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height # see the Product Defaults section for more info
          spec: 
            # Variables are the required parameters needed for the product generation 
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "latitude", "longitude"]

#. To use your product that you just created, you'll need to create a bash script that
   implements ``run_procflow`` (run-process-workflow). This script defines the
   *process-workflow* needed to generate your product. It can be used to specify how you want your product to be created, 
   output format, and define the sector you'd like your data to be plotted on apart from 
   enlisting comparison of the output product with a validated product(optional).

GeoIPS is called via a command line interface (CLI). The primary command that you will use is
``run_procflow`` which will process your data through the selected procflow using the specified
plugins. Scripts are stored in your plugin package's ``tests/`` directory as they can be later used 
for regression test of package you're developing.

Creating a Script to Visualize Your Product
-------------------------------------------

#. Check if you have the test data for the clavrx within ``$GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR`` and if not run the following.
   :: 

       $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips/setup/check_system_requirements.sh test_data test_data_clavrx 

  We'll now create a test script to generate an image for the product you just created.

#. Change directories into your scripts directory.
   ::

        cd $MY_PKG_DIR/tests/scripts

#. Create a bash bash file called clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-top-height.sh and edit it
   to include the codeblock below.

   .. code-block:: bash

       run_procflow \
           $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR/test_data_clavrx/data/goes16_2023101_1600/clavrx_OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M6C01_G16_s20231011600207.level2.hdf \
           --procflow single_source \
           --reader_name clavrx_hdf4 \
           --product_name My-Cloud-Top-Height \
           --output_formatter imagery_annotated \
           --filename_formatter geoips_fname \
           --minimum_coverage 0 \
           --sector_list conus
       ss_retval=$?

As shown above, we define which procflow we want to use, which reader,
what product will be displayed, how to output it, which filename formatter will be used,
the minimum coverage needed to create an output (% based), as well as the sector used to
plot the data. Many more items can be added if wanted. If you'd like some examples of
that, feel free to peruse the `GeoIPS Scripts Directory <https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips/tree/main/tests/scripts>`_.

Once these changes have been created, we can run our test script to produce Cloud Top
Height Imagery. To do so, run your script using the line shown below.
::

    $MY_PKG_DIR/tests/scripts/clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-top-height.sh

This will write some log output. If your script succeeded it will end with INTERACTIVE:
Return Value 0. To view your output, look for a line that says SINGLESOURCESUCCESS. Open
the PNG file, it should look like the image below.

.. image:: ../../images/command_line_examples/my_cloud_top_height.png
   :width: 800

Okay! We've developed a plugin which produces CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height. This is nice,
but what if we want to extend our plugin to produce Cloud Base Height? What about Cloud
Depth? Using the method shown above, we're going to extend our my_clavrx_products.yaml
to produce just that.

Using your definition of My-Cloud-Top-Height as an example, create a product definition
for My-Cloud-Base-Height.
::

    cd $MY_PKG_DIR/$MY_PKG_NAME/plugins/yaml/products

Now, edit my_clavrx_products.yaml. Here are some helpful hints:
  * The relevant variable in the CLAVR-x output file (and the equivalent GeoIPS reader) is called "cld_height_base"
  * The Cloud-Height product_default can be used to simplify this product definition (or you can DIY or override if you'd like!)

The correct products implementation for 'my_clavrx_products.yaml' is shown below.
Hopefully, you didn't have to make any changes after seeing this! Developing products,
and other types of plugins should be somewhat intuitive after completing this tutorial.

.. code-block:: yaml

    interface: products
    family: list
    name: my_clavrx_products
    docstring: |
      CLAVR-x imagery products
    spec:
      products:
        - name: My-Cloud-Top-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Base-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Base Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]

Now that we have products for both Cloud Top Height and Cloud Base Height, we can
develop a product that produces Cloud Depth. To do so, use your definitions of
My-Cloud-Top-Height and My-Cloud-Base-Height as examples, create a product definition
for My-Cloud-Depth.
::

    cd $MY_PKG_DIR/$MY_PKG_NAME/plugins/yaml/products

Edit my_clavrx_products.yaml. Here is a helful hint to get you started:
  * We will define Cloud Depth for this tutorial as the difference between CTH and CBH

.. code-block:: yaml

    interface: products
    family: list
    name: my_clavrx_products
    docstring: |
      CLAVR-x imagery products
    spec:
      products:
        - name: My-Cloud-Top-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Base-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Base Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Depth
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Depth
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]

We now have two variables, but if we examine the `Cloud-Height Product Defaults <https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips_clavrx/blob/main/geoips_clavrx/plugins/yaml/product_defaults/Cloud-Height.yaml>`_
we see that it uses the ``single_channel`` algorithm. This doesn't work for our use case,
since the ``single_channel`` algorithm just manipulates a single data variable and
plots it. Therefore, we need a new algorithm! See the
:ref:`Algorithms Section<add-an-algorithm>` to keep moving forward with this turorial.

.. _cloud-depth-product1:

Using Your Cloud Depth Product
------------------------------

Note: Before moving forward in this section, make sure you've completed
:ref:`creating a new algorithm<add-an-algorithm>`. We are going to modify our Cloud
Depth product to use the algorithm we just created.

Now that we've created our cloud depth algorithm, we need to implement it in our cloud
depth product. As shown in the :ref:`Product Defaults Section<create-product-defaults>`,
we can override the product defaults specified to our own specification. To do so,
modify ``My-Cloud-Depth`` product in my_clavrx_products.yaml to the code block shown
below.

.. code-block:: yaml

  interface: products
    family: list
    name: my_clavrx_products
    docstring: |
      CLAVR-x imagery products
    spec:
      products:
        - name: My-Cloud-Top-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Base-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Base Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Depth
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Depth
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]
            algorithm:
              plugin:
                name: my_cloud_depth
                arguments:
                  output_data_range: [0, 20]
                  scale_factor: 0.001

The changes shown above modify My-Cloud-Depth to use our ``my_cloud_depth`` algorithm
that we created. If we left this portion unchanged, My-Cloud-Depth would use the
``single_channel`` algorithm, which is unfit for our purposes. We also added two other
arguments, ``output_data_range`` ands ``scale_factor``, which override the Cloud-Height
product defaults arguments for those two variables. Output data range of [0, 20] states
that our data will be in the range of zero to twenty, and the scale factor says that we
are scaling our data to be in kilometers.

To use this modified My-Cloud-Depth product, follow the series of commands. We will be
creating a new test script which implements our new changes.
::

    cd $MY_PKG_DIR/tests/scripts
    cp clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-top-height.sh clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-depth.sh

Now we need to edit ``clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-depth.sh`` to implement
``My-Cloud-Depth`` rather than ``My-Cloud-Top-Height``. Your new test script should look
like the code shown below.

.. code-block:: bash

  run_procflow \
      $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR/test_data_clavrx/data/goes16_2023101_1600/clavrx_OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M6C01_G16_s20231011600207.level2.hdf \
      --procflow single_source \
      --reader_name clavrx_hdf4 \
      --product_name My-Cloud-Depth \
      --output_formatter imagery_annotated \
      --filename_formatter geoips_fname \
      --minimum_coverage 0 \
      --sector_list conus
  ss_retval=$?

Nice! Now all we need to do is run our script. This will display Cloud Depth over the
CONUS sector. To do so, run the command below.
::

    $MY_PKG_DIR/tests/scripts/clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-depth.sh

This will output a bunch of log output. If your script succeeded it will end with INFO:
Return Value 0. To view your output, look for a line that says SINGLESOURCESUCCESS. Open
the PNG file to view your Cloud Depth Image! It should look like the image shown below.

.. image:: ../../images/command_line_examples/my_cloud_depth.png

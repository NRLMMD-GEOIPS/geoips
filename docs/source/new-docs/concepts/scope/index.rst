   - Does NOT include

     - A roadmap
     - A history of GeoIPS
     - A grant proposal
     - Information on how GeoIPS works, this is "why this a cake, and not a pie. more specifically, this is why it's
       chocolate and not vanilla. It will never be vanilla, but maybe someday it will be strawberry.", not "why cakes
       are so much better than pies, or why we used 100g of sugar instead of 101g of sugar".
       For more information, please
       read `this primer on explanation in python documentation
       <https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/explanation/>`

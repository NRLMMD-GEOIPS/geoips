**********************************
Extend GeoIPS with new Products
**********************************

This section discusses how to create multiple products for CLAVR-x data, specifically
Cloud-Top-Height, Cloud-Base-Height, and Cloud-Depth. Products are the cornerstone
plugin for GeoIPS, as they define how to produce a specific product as a combination of
other plugins. Products use other plugins, such as an algorithm, colormapper,
interpolater, etc. to generate the correct result.

We will now go hands on in creating a product for CLAVR-x Cloud-Top-Height.

#. First off, change directories to your product plugins directory.
   ::

        cd $MY_PKG_DIR/$MY_PKG_NAME/plugins/yaml/products

#. Now, create a file called ``my_clavrx_products.yaml``, which we'll fill in soon.
   Before we add any code let's discuss some of the top level attributes that are
   required in any GeoIPS plugin:
   ``interface``, ``family``, and ``docstring``.

Please see documentation for
:ref:`additional info on these GeoIPS required attributes<required-attributes>`

Creating a GeoIPS Product Plugin
--------------------------------

The code snippet shown below shows properties required in every GeoIPS plugin, YAML or
Module-based. These properties help GeoIPS define what type of plugin you are developing
and also defines what schema your plugin will be validated against.

Copy and paste the code shown below into my_clavrx_products.yaml.

.. code-block:: yaml

    interface: products
    family: list
    name: my_clavrx_products
    docstring: |
      CLAVR-x imagery products

Now we'll update the ``spec`` portion of the yaml file to support our new product plugin.
``spec`` is a container for the 'specification' of your yaml plugin. In this case, it
contains a list of ``products``, as shown below. Denoted by the ``family: list``
property shown above, this yaml file will contain a list of products, which can be of
length 1 if you so desire.

Copy and paste the code block below under your to the end of your file. spec should be
right under the docstring you wrote, with no tabs behind it. YAML is a whitespace-based
coding language, similar to Python in that aspect. Feel free to remove the comments, as
they just describe what each property does.

.. code-block:: yaml

    spec:
      products:
        - name: My-Cloud-Top-Height # The name of the product you're defining (can be anything)
          source_names: [clavrx] # Defined as metadata in the corresponding reader
          docstring: | # Pipe says to YAML this will be a multiline comment, can be anything
            CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height # See the Product Defaults section for more info
          spec: # Variables are the neccessary variables which are needed to produce your product
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "latitude", "longitude"]

To use your product that you just created, you'll need to create a bash script that
implements ``run_procflow`` (run-process-workflow). This is a script which defines the
*process-workflow* needed to generate your product. We'll keep this short for now, but you
are able to strictly define how you want your product to be created, as well as what
format you'd like it outputted as. You can also define the sector you'd like your data
to be plotted on, as well as compare the output product to a validated product if wanted.

GeoIPS is called via a command line interface (CLI). The main command that you will use is
run_procflow which will run your data through the selected procflow using the specified
plugins. It's easiest to do this via a script, and scripts are stored in your plugin
package's ``tests/`` directory because they can be used later to regression test your
package.

Creating a Script to Visualize Your Product
-------------------------------------------

We'll now create a test script to generate an image for the product you just created.

#. Change directories into your scripts directory.
   ::

        cd $MY_PKG_DIR/tests/scripts

#. Create a bash file called clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-top-height.sh and edit it
   to include the codeblock below.

.. code-block:: bash

    run_procflow \
        $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR/test_data_clavrx/data/goes16_2023101_1600/clavrx_OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M6C01_G16_s20231011600207.level2.hdf \
        --procflow single_source \
        --reader_name clavrx_hdf4 \
        --product_name My-Cloud-Top-Height \
        --output_formatter imagery_annotated \
        --filename_formatter geoips_fname \
        --minimum_coverage 0 \
        --sector_list conus
    ss_retval=$?

As shown above, we define which procflow we want to use, which reader,
what product will be displayed, how to output it, which filename formatter will be used,
the minimum coverage needed to create an output (% based), as well as the sector used to
plot the data. Many more items can be added if wanted. If you'd like some examples of
that, feel free to peruse the `GeoIPS Scripts Directory <https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips/tree/main/tests/scripts>`_.

Once these changes have been created, we can run our test script to produce Cloud Top
Height Imagery. To do so, run your script using the line shown below.
::

    $MY_PKG_DIR/tests/scripts/clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-top-height.sh

This will write some log output. If your script succeeded it will end with INTERACTIVE:
Return Value 0. To view your output, look for a line that says SINGLESOURCESUCCESS. Open
the PNG file, it should look like the image below.

.. image:: ../../images/command_line_examples/my_cloud_top_height.png
   :width: 800

Okay! We've developed a plugin which produces CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height. This is nice,
but what if we want to extend our plugin to produce Cloud Base Height? What about Cloud
Depth? Using the method shown above, we're going to extend our my_clavrx_products.yaml
to produce just that.

Using your definition of My-Cloud-Top-Height as an example, create a product definition
for My-Cloud-Base-Height.
::

    cd $MY_PKG_DIR/$MY_PKG_NAME/plugins/yaml/products

Now, edit my_clavrx_products.yaml. Here are some helpful hints:
  * The relevant variable in the CLAVR-x output file (and the equivalent GeoIPS reader) is called "cld_height_base"
  * The Cloud-Height product_default can be used to simplify this product definition (or you can DIY or override if you'd like!)

The correct products implementation for 'my_clavrx_products.yaml' is shown below.
Hopefully, you didn't have to make any changes after seeing this! Developing products,
and other types of plugins should be somewhat intuitive after completing this tutorial.

.. code-block:: yaml

    interface: products
    family: list
    name: my_clavrx_products
    docstring: |
      CLAVR-x imagery products
    spec:
      products:
        - name: My-Cloud-Top-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Base-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Base Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]

Now that we have products for both Cloud Top Height and Cloud Base Height, we can
develop a product that produces Cloud Depth. To do so, use your definitions of
My-Cloud-Top-Height and My-Cloud-Base-Height as examples, create a product definition
for My-Cloud-Depth.
::

    cd $MY_PKG_DIR/$MY_PKG_NAME/plugins/yaml/products

Edit my_clavrx_products.yaml. Here is a helful hint to get you started:
  * We will define Cloud Depth for this tutorial as the difference between CTH and CBH

.. code-block:: yaml

    interface: products
    family: list
    name: my_clavrx_products
    docstring: |
      CLAVR-x imagery products
    spec:
      products:
        - name: My-Cloud-Top-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Base-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Base Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Depth
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Depth
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]

We now have two variables, but if we examine the `Cloud-Height Product Defaults <https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips_clavrx/blob/main/geoips_clavrx/plugins/yaml/product_defaults/Cloud-Height.yaml>`_
we see that it uses the ``single_channel`` algorithm. This doesn't work for our use case,
since the ``single_channel`` algorithm just manipulates a single data variable and
plots it. Therefore, we need a new algorithm! See the
:ref:`Algorithms Section<add-an-algorithm>` to keep moving forward with this turorial.

.. _cloud-depth-product:

Using Your Cloud Depth Product
------------------------------

Note: Before moving forward in this section, make sure you've completed
:ref:`creating a new algorithm<add-an-algorithm>`. We are going to modify our Cloud
Depth product to use the algorithm we just created.

Now that we've created our cloud depth algorithm, we need to implement it in our cloud
depth product. As shown in the :ref:`Product Defaults Section<create-product-defaults>`,
we can override the product defaults specified to our own specification. To do so,
modify ``My-Cloud-Depth`` product in my_clavrx_products.yaml to the code block shown
below.

.. code-block:: yaml

  interface: products
    family: list
    name: my_clavrx_products
    docstring: |
      CLAVR-x imagery products
    spec:
      products:
        - name: My-Cloud-Top-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Top Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Base-Height
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Base Height
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]
        - name: My-Cloud-Depth
          source_names: [clavrx]
          docstring: |
            CLAVR-x Cloud Depth
          product_defaults: Cloud-Height
          spec:
            variables: ["cld_height_acha", "cld_height_base", "latitude", "longitude"]
            algorithm:
              plugin:
                name: my_cloud_depth
                arguments:
                  output_data_range: [0, 20]
                  scale_factor: 0.001

The changes shown above modify My-Cloud-Depth to use our ``my_cloud_depth`` algorithm
that we created. If we left this portion unchanged, My-Cloud-Depth would use the
``single_channel`` algorithm, which is unfit for our purposes. We also added two other
arguments, ``output_data_range`` ands ``scale_factor``, which override the Cloud-Height
product defaults arguments for those two variables. Output data range of [0, 20] states
that our data will be in the range of zero to twenty, and the scale factor says that we
are scaling our data to be in kilometers.

To use this modified My-Cloud-Depth product, follow the series of commands. We will be
creating a new test script which implements our new changes.
::

    cd $MY_PKG_DIR/tests/scripts
    cp clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-top-height.sh clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-depth.sh

Now we need to edit ``clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-depth.sh`` to implement
``My-Cloud-Depth`` rather than ``My-Cloud-Top-Height``. Your new test script should look
like the code shown below.

.. code-block:: bash

  run_procflow \
      $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR/test_data_clavrx/data/goes16_2023101_1600/clavrx_OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M6C01_G16_s20231011600207.level2.hdf \
      --procflow single_source \
      --reader_name clavrx_hdf4 \
      --product_name My-Cloud-Depth \
      --output_formatter imagery_annotated \
      --filename_formatter geoips_fname \
      --minimum_coverage 0 \
      --sector_list conus
  ss_retval=$?

Nice! Now all we need to do is run our script. This will display Cloud Depth over the
CONUS sector. To do so, run the command below.
::

    $MY_PKG_DIR/tests/scripts/clavrx.conus_annotated.my-cloud-depth.sh

This will output a bunch of log output. If your script succeeded it will end with INFO:
Return Value 0. To view your output, look for a line that says SINGLESOURCESUCCESS. Open
the PNG file to view your Cloud Depth Image! It should look like the image shown below.

.. image:: ../../images/command_line_examples/my_cloud_depth.png

Extend GeoIPS with Plugins
**************************

GeoIPS is almost entirely composed of plugins and can be extended by developing
new plugins in external python packages. The ability to extend GeoIPS using
plugins means that there is no need to edit the main GeoIPS code to add new
functionality.  Most types of functionality in GeoIPS can be extended. If you
encounter something that you would like to be able to extend but are unable to,
please contact the GeoIPS team or create an issue on GitHub.

Developing a new plugin for GeoIPS requires developing a new Python package that GeoIPS
terms a "plugin package". The plugin package can contain one or more plugins. It is
configured in a special way such that, when it is installed,
it registers itself and its plugins with GeoIPS.

An example repository `Template Basic Plugin <https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/template_basic_plugin/tree/main>`_
is provided that can guide you through the process of creating a new plugin package
containing one or more custom plugins.

GeoIPS Plugin Vocabulary
========================

Plugin
------
A GeoIPS plugin may be either a Python module or a YAML file that extends GeoIPS with
new functionality. Whether a plugin is a Python module or a YAML file is determined by
its interface.

Plugins are stored in installable Python packages that register their payload with
GeoIPS through the use of `entrypoints <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/>`_.

Module-based Plugin
-------------------
A module-based plugin is a plugin that extends GeoIPS by adding new
functionality that is capable of performing an action (e.g. apply an algorithm,
read data, apply formatting, etc.).  Module-based plugins are defined as a
single python module that contains a handful of required top-level variables and
a single function that performs the action of the plugin. Examples of
module-based plugins include ``algorithms``, ``readers``, and various types of
formatters.

YAML-based Plugin
-----------------
A YAML-based plugin is a plugin that extends GeoIPS by adding a new set of
static configuration options for GeoIPS.  Examples of YAML-based plugins include
``sectors``, ``products``, and ``feature-annotators``.

Interface
---------

An ``interface`` defines a class of GeoIPS plugins that extend the same type of
functionality within GeoIPS. For example, some commonly used interfaces include the
``algorithms``, ``colormappers``, and ``sectors`` interfaces.

Family
------

A ``family`` is a subset of an interface's plugins which accept specific sets of
arguments/properties. Module-based plugins of the same ``family`` have similar call
signatures. YAML-based plugins of the same ``family`` are validated against the same
schema (i.e. they contain the same properties).

Docstring
---------

A ``docstring`` is a chunk of documentation which describes what your plugin does. This
property is required for every GeoIPS plugin created, module-based or YAML-based. We
require this property for proper documentation of created plugins, and it will also be
a useful feature later on when the GeoIPS Command Line Interface (CLI) is created, as
you will be able to see what each plugin does provided the ``docstring`` for that plugin
is filled.

Setting up for Plugin Development
=================================

1. To develop a new GeoIPS plugin, first :ref:`install GeoIPS<linux-installation>` and ensure
   that you have your environment enabled and all environment variables set as described in
   the installation instructions.

2. Then, choose a name for your package. By contention the package name should:

   * be all lower case
   * start with a letter
   * contain only letters, numbers, and underscores

   From here on, anywhere ``@package@`` is used should be replaced with your chosen package
   name.

3. Clone the ``template_basic_plugin`` repository, rename it, and remove the link to github.
   ::

       cd $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR
       git clone --no-tags --single-branch https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/template_basic_plugin.git

       # Replace @package@ with your package name, removing the @s
       mv template_basic_plugin @package@
       cd $MY_PKG_NAME
       git remote remove origin template_basic_plugin.git

4. Update readme.md

   The ``readme.md`` file describes your plugin package and should be updated to match your
   package. To do this, edit ``README.md`` to:

   * Replace all instances of ``@package@`` with your package name.
   * Search for all remaining ``@`` within the file and follow the included instructions to
     update the readme appropriately.
   * Remove all lines containing ``@``.

5. Update pyproject.toml

   Installing a Python package requires metadata that describes the package and how to
   install it. GeoIPS uses ``pyproject.toml`` to define this information. We, additionally,
   make GeoIPS aware of plugin packages using ``entry-points``.

   To update ``pyproject.toml`` for your package, edit the file to:

   * Update ``@package@`` to your package name.
   * Update ``my_package`` to your package name.
   * Add any python package depenencies to the ``install_requires`` section.

6. Add and commit your changes.
   ::

      git add README.md pyproject.toml
      git commit -m "Updated name of template plugin package to mine"

7. Install your package using the changes you just made.

   Note: Any time you edit ``pyproject.toml``, you must reinstall your package. Without
   doing this, GeoIPS will not be aware of your new changes, since it will be in the
   previous install state, which doesn't include any new updates to this file.

   ::

      pip install -e $MY_PKG_DIR

   The ``-e`` portion of the command above means 'editable', so we can edit the package
   after it is installed and changes will be reflected in the installed package. Again,
   the only time you must reinstall is when you edit ``pyproject.toml``, which
   generally only occurs when you create new module based plugins, and must add them as
   entry-points to ``pyproject.toml``. This is further discussed in the
   :ref:`Algorithms Section<add-an-algorithm>`.

Defining pyproject.toml
-----------------------

Installing Python packages requires metadata that describes the package and how to
install it.

pyproject.toml defines this information for pip, including:
    * Package name, version, description, license, etc.
    * Which files should be contained in the package when installed
    * How to build the package

We make GeoIPS aware of our package using the “geoips.plugin_packages” namespace
(allows GeoIPS to find YAML-based plugins)

And makes it aware of our module-based plugins using one namespace per interface
(e.g. “geoips.algorithms”).

Building a Custom GeoIPS Package
--------------------------------

Note, this any section below assumes you have completed either the :ref:`linux-installation`,
the :ref:`mac-installation`, or the :ref:`expert-installation`. If you havent, please complete
those steps before moving forward.

We will now go hands on in creating a :ref:`Product<create-a-product>` for your custom
GeoIPS Package.

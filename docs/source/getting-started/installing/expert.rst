Expert User Installation (with administrative privileges)
*********************************************************

The :ref:`Complete Local conda-based GeoIPS Installation<linux-installation>`
is the easiest way to get GeoIPS up and running, but if you have administrative
privileges on your system, and are confident you can install all the required
system dependencies yourself, you can install GeoIPS by setting a few environment
variables for testing purposes.

def main(index_filename, release_note_path):
    """Generate an index.rst file for release notes.

    This function scans the specified directory for release note files, sorts them based
    on version numbers (and alpha releases), and generates an
    ``index.rst`` file that includes a table of contents.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index_filename : str or Path
        The path to the output ``index.rst`` file to be generated.
    release_note_path : str or Path
        The directory containing release note ``.rst`` files.

    Notes
    -----
    The function processes release note files that match the following naming patterns:

    - ``vX_Y_Z.rst``
    - ``vX_Y_ZaN.rst``
    - ``X.Y.Z.rst``
    - ``X.Y.ZaN.rst``

    where ``X``, ``Y``, ``Z``, and ``N`` are integers representing the major, minor,
    bugfix, and alpha version numbers, respectively.

    Release notes not matching these patterns are ignored.

    If a file named ``latest.rst`` exists in the ``release_note_path``, it is included
    at the top of the generated index under the heading "Latest (version on cutting edge
    of git)".

    It excludes ``index.rst`` and ``latest.rst`` from the list of release notes
    to be processed (except for including ``latest.rst`` at the top if it exists).

    The release notes are sorted in reverse chronological order (newest first) based on
    their version numbers.

    The function does not include high-level version summaries from
    ``version_summaries.yaml``; these are not currently populated in ``index.rst``.
    These will be included when brassy takes over this functionality.

    Examples
    --------
    Generate an ``index.rst`` file from release notes in ``docs/releases``:

    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> index_file = 'docs/releases/index.rst'
    >>> release_notes_dir = 'docs/releases'
    >>> main(index_file, release_notes_dir)
    """
    index_filename = Path(index_filename)
    release_note_path = Path(release_note_path)

    # in docs/source/releases/version_summaries.yaml, but are not currently being
    # populated in index.rst.  When this release note index creation is moved to
    # brassy, the version summaries will be pulled from version_summaries.yaml
    # to include in the index.rst.

    # Note this will sort release notes properly named as:
    # * vX_Y_Z.rst
    # * vX_Y_ZaN.rst
    # * X.Y.Z.rst
    # * X.Y.ZaN.rst

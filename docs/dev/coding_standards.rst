*"Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch."* - the Zen of Python


Summary
=======

The goal is consistency. In style, we're in the right even if we're all wrong together. GeoIPS code is meant to be re-used by many, and we expect that the code will be read much more than it is written. The goal of this document is to help us spend less time on conventions and more time making GeoIPS better.

We use - in order of supremacy - a few Internal Standards, followed by the numpy docstring standards and the python style guide laid out in PEP 8.

This document will detail internal standard conventions and include some of the external standards for easy reference. For external standards, the primary source is always right in the case of a conflict with this document.

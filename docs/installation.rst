GeoIPS Base Installation Guide
==================================

Using a fresh Mini/Anaconda Python 3.9 Environment is the easiest way to get geoips up and running.

GeoIPS does not support Python 2 development.

System Dependencies
----------------------
Required

* Python >= 3.9 (3.9 required for entry points)
* cartopy >= 0.20.3 (0.21.0 required for matplotlib 3.6.0, does not install cleanly via pip)
* rclone (required to obtain ABI and AHI test data from AWS)
* Test data repos contained in $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR (required for tests to pass)
* wget (Miniconda and rclone setup)
* git >= 2.19.1 (git -C commands in complete installation)
* git-lfs (required for clones of test data repos)
* imagemagick (required for test output comparisons)

Optional

* gfortran (only required for plugins including fortran builds)
* gcc (required for plugins including fortran or C builds, build-essential)
* screen (convenience package)
* ncurses (only required if building vim, ncurses and libncurses5-dev)

`Complete conda-based GeoIPS Installation`_ and Test
-----------------------------------------------------

.. _Complete conda-based GeoIPS Installation: https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips/blob/main/docs/installation.rst#complete-conda-based-geoips-installation-and-test

This installation method includes the first 4 system requirements (Python, cartopy, rclone, and test repos)
through a complete install of conda, geoips, test repos, and all Python dependencies.

This is the fully supported installation method (as all installations performed in
this manner are identical, and the GeoIPS Team can more easily provide assistance as needed).

Expert User GeoIPS Installation
---------------------------------

If you already have all system requirements installed (Python+cartopy), and do not wish to go through
the full interactive installation process above (which includes conda, rclone, test data, etc),
you can clone the geoips repo and pip install from the your local copy.

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips/geoips.git <installation_location> 
    cd <installation location>
    pip install -e .

Complete Local conda-based GeoIPS Installation
================================================
This is the fully supported installation method, which involves installing the entire Python environment
from scratch using conda, to allow for consistency across installations.  This process ensures source code,
test datasets, etc are all contained in the same location to facilitate assisting users if issues arise
during the installation, testing, and development process.

GeoIPS Environment Variables for Complete conda-based Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    # Set up appropriate environment variables for conda-based geoips setup steps.
    # The steps within this section will need to be copied and pasted into your shell any time you want to
    # run the conda-based setup commands directly. Typical users do not have to make any modifications to the
    # commands within this README and can copy and paste directly.

    # Once geoips has been installed, the "GEOIPS_CONFIG_FILE" specified below will be sourced when running geoips,
    # and the direct environment variable assignments within this section are no longer required.

    # If you would like to have the GEOIPS_CONFIG_FILE automatically sourced so you do not have to manually run the 
    # appropriate source command for every new shell, you can add 
    # source </full/path/to/GEOIPS_CONFIG_FILE>
    # to your ~/.bashrc file

    git lfs install  # Required to clone test data repositories!
    export GEOIPS_BASEDIR=$HOME/geoproc  # Contains all source, output, and external dependencies
    export GEOIPS_REPO_URL=https://github.com/NRLMMD-GeoIPS  # Point to base URL for git clone commands
    GEOIPS_ACTIVE_BRANCH=main

    # GeoIPS packages, test_data, and dependencies all default to locations under "GEOIPS_BASEDIR"
    export GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR=$GEOIPS_BASEDIR/geoips_packages
    export GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR=$GEOIPS_BASEDIR/test_data
    export GEOIPS_DEPENDENCIES_DIR=$GEOIPS_BASEDIR/geoips_dependencies

    # This config file must be sourced ANY TIME you want to run geoips
    # You can create your own user/site specific version to replace this one as needed.
    export GEOIPS_CONFIG_FILE=$GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips/setup/config_geoips

Complete conda-based Installation and Test
----------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    # Initial clone of geoips repo, to obtain setup scripts
    mkdir -p $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR
    git clone $GEOIPS_REPO_URL/geoips.git $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips
    
    # This just makes sure you are *really* on $GEOIPS_ACTIVE_BRANCH
    git -C $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips pull
    git -C $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips checkout -t origin/$GEOIPS_ACTIVE_BRANCH
    git -C $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips checkout $GEOIPS_ACTIVE_BRANCH
    git -C $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips pull

    # These helper scripts will just confirm all required system requirements are available.
    # Please confirm output before proceeding with base_install_and_test.sh

    # This prompts you through all the steps of installing geoips from scratch, using the parameters specified above
    # Installs and tests everything!
    # Requires <30GB disk space, <8GB memory
    # Low memory option. No high res Visible outputs.  Same setup, just different tests.

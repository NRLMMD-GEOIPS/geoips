$id: sectors.specs.center
type: object
description: |
  The center sector configuration. Defines the area in which the sector
  encompasses. This is done by providing metadata to descibe the sector's area
  alongside PROJ Projection information which defines the spatial extent of the sector.
  The difference between this sector versus area_definition is that area_definition
  defines the sector via it's area_extent, whereas center sector defines the sector
  via a center point and a width/height shape in pixels. See
  schema/sectors/metadata_families/*.yaml for more information.

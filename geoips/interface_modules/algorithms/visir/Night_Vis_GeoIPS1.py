    ''' Data manipulation steps for "rgb" product algorithm.

    This algorithm expects DNBRad in reflectance and M16BT Brightness Temperatures in units of degrees Kelvin,
    and returns red green and blue gun arrays.
    it will generate a product in daytime if we do not apply the daytime chech. For now, it is for both day/night.
    (Will decide whether this product is only for nighttime.  if so, a daytime check is required.)
    We might focus only on nighttime product with moonlight after additional validation (TBD). 

    Args:
        data (list[numpy.ndarray]) : 
            * list of numpy.ndarray or numpy.MaskedArray of channel data, in order of sensor "channels" list
            * Degrees Kelvin

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray : numpy.ndarray or numpy.MaskedArray of qualitative RGBA image output

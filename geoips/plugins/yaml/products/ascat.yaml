ASACAT: 
  The Advanced SCATterometer is real aperture radar (5.255 GHz C-band) and uses vertically polarized antennas. Measures wind speed 
  and direction over oceans. Also useful for polar ice, tropical vegetation, subsurface climate related features. 

  Used on
  METOP-B/C - Meteorological operational satellite – B and Meteorological operational satellite – C. METOP-B, launched in September, 2012, 
  has an altitude of 817 km, inclination of 98.7°, and orbital period of 101 minutes, while METOP-C has an altitude of 817 km, 
  inclination of 98.7°, orbital period of 101 minutes and was launched November, 2018. Sun-synchronous and orbits daily.

  The ascat product_inputs configuration, which produces Windspeed products, Windbarbs products, Wind-ambiguity products,
  and Unsectored/Sectored products.

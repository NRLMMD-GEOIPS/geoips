  VIIRS: Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite. From the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NVIIRS contains 
  22 channels and has a swath of 3000km. The sensor passes a point on earth twice a day and has a spatial resolution of 750m or 375m 
  depending on the wavelength. 

  Used on:
  NPP: Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership. Launched by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National 
  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NPP orbits at an altitude of 833 km, has an orbital period of 101.44 minutes, and has an orbital 
  inclination of 98.79°. Included in the Joint Polar Satellite System alongside NOAA-20 and -21.

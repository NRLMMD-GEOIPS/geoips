        6.9 µm Mid-Level Water Vapor. In this product, the effective layer lies in the uppermost region of appreciable water vapor. This product 
        utilizes channel 9 (6.9 µm) and is a mid-level product that can view as low as 500mb level. Warm colors illustrate cold (higher) effective 
        layers and cool colors illustrate warm (lower) effective layers. This can show forecasters how much potential a storm has to develop and the 
        locations of dry slots.

        7.3 µm Low-Level Water Vapor. In this product, the effective layer lies in the uppermost region of appreciable water vapor.  This product 
        utilizes channel 10 (7.3 µm) and is a lower-level product that can view as low as 750mb level. This can show the forecaster how much potential 
        a storm has to develop and the locations of dry slots.

        6.9 µm Mid-Level Water Vapor. In this product, the effective layer lies in the uppermost region of appreciable water vapor. This product
        utilizes channel 9 (6.9 µm) and is a mid-level product that can view as low as 500 mb level. Warm colors illustrate cold (higher) effective layers
        and cool colors illustrate warm (lower) effective layers. This can show forecasters how much potential a storm has to develop and the locations
        of dry slots.

  ```

  GOES West subsector, centered at 36 latitude, -121 longitude
  300x300 at 3km resolution
  Shows scan during the day time.

  This sector is off the coast of California, containing approximately half land and
  half ocean pixels for GOES West.
  It is a very small sector that can be used for GOES West processing
  using the abi dataset 20210718T0150Z.

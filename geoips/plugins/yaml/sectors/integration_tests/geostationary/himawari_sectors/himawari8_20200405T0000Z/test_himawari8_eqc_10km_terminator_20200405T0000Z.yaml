  data along the western edge of scan.

  This sector is off the coast of Myanmar, containing approximately half ocean
  and half land pixels for Himawari.

  This sector was designed to contain approximately one quarter night-time data
  along the western edge of the sector, and three quarters day-time data.

  The test datasets corresponding to these sectors can be found in the

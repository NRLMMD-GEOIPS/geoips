  MeteoIO subsector, centered at 37 latitude, 0 longitude
  300x300 at 3km resolution

  This sector is off the coast of Spain, Algeria, and Morocco, and over the
  Mediterranean, containing approximately half ocean and half land pixels for
  MeteoIO.

  It is a very small sector that can be used for MeteoIO Processing
  for any MeteoIO dataset.

  The test datasets corresponding to these sectors can be found in the
  test_data_seviri test data repository.

  Note the METEO-IO satellite location refers to the following METEOSAT satellites

  * MSG-1 (aka METEOSAT-8, sensor SEVIRI)
  * MSG-2 (aka METEOSAT-9, sensor SEVIRI)

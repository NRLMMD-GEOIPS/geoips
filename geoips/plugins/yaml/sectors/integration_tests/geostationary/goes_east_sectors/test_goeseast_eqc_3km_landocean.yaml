  GOES East land/ocean subsector, centered at 3 latitude, -77.5 longitude
  300x300 at 3km resolution

  This sector is off the coast of Columbia, containing approximately half land and
  half ocean pixels, near the center of scan for GOES East.

  It is a very small sector that can be used for any basic GOES East test processing
  that is not reliant on specific meteorological features or time of day being
  contained within the dataset.

  This sector is identical to the test_goeseast_eqc_3km_nadir test sector, as the
  nadir test sector provides a good combination of land and ocean pixels.

"""Data manipulation steps for "Night_Vis_IR" product.

def call(arrays):
    """Apply default RGB algorithm.

    Plots RGB with the red gun being the first variable specified in the
    product YAML, green second, and blue third.

    Note this is currently entirely unused, and is included here for
    reference/completeness.  Eventually we may want to fully support
    this generalized RGB default algorithm, where you can pass in
    ranges, channel combinations, etc for RGB output, but for now it
    will ONLY plot arrays 0, 1, 2 as red, green, blue respectively,
    with no adjustments/combinations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : list of numpy.ndarray
        * list of numpy.ndarray or numpy.MaskedArray of channel data,
            in order of sensor "channels" list

    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        numpy.ndarray or numpy.MaskedArray of qualitative RGBA image output

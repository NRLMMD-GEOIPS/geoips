    """Night-Vis algorithm data manipulation steps, standard version.

    DNB obs for visible product.

    This algorithm expects radaiance, between 0 and 2.5*10^-8

    This is only for nighttime product.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : list of numpy.ndarray
        * list of numpy.ndarray or numpy.MaskedArray of channel data
        * Channel data: Radiance, between 0 and 2.5*10^-8

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        numpy.ndarray or numpy.MaskedArray of appropriately scaled channel data

    Notes
    -----
    Due to a relative maximum value of the DNBRad is much larger than
    that of the majority pixels in  moonlight/lighting situation,
    it could lead to a black image if the original maximum is
    used to normalize the data (i.e., the normlized value is close to 0).
    Thus, we need to setup an tuning factor to normalize the DNBRad.

    We start to use 0.05 to tune the val_max in moonlight/other lighing source,
    0.5 for no lighting source.

    We might have to generate night-vis product only when moonlight is present
    (TBD).

def write_bad_comparisons_to_file(badcomps, compare_products, compare_strings, diffdir):
    """Write text file with cp commands to update products with bad comparisons.

    Write a text file that can be sourced to replace test output comparison files
    with the most recent outputs when the output checker returns a bad comparisons.

    When GeoIPS is updated in a way that changes the imagery and those changes
    are expected, the integration test image comparisons will fail. This
    function writes a file named `cp_BADCOMPARES.txt` which can be
    sourced to copy the new comparison files into place, overwriting
    the previous comparison files. This allows easily updating the test
    comparison outputs when code updates make expected changes to the
    output imagery.

    We must ensure we also gzip the comparison product in the test outputs
    directory after copying if the original test comparison output file was
    gzipped.  If applicable, a gzip command will also be added to
    cp_BADCOMPARES.txt.

    Parameters
    ----------
    badcomps: list
        List of files that returned a "BAD COMPARISON" from the output checker.
        These are the full paths to the files produced during the most recent

        product file name, the gunzipped product file path if applicable,

        "badcomps" files.
    compare_strings : list of str
        List of all comparison "tags" included in goodcomps and badcomps lists.

        * This list is used to remove the comparison tags from goodcomps and

        kwargs: dict
            Additional arguments to pass through to "outputs_match" method.

        Returns
        -------
        goodcomps: list of str
            All current good comparisons appended to the list passed in.
        badcomps: list of str
            All current bad comparisons appended to the list passed in.
        compare_strings: list of str
            All current comparison "tags" added to the list passed in.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            Raised when current output product does not have an associated
            comparison test defined.

    description: |
      The `geoips config` command's subcommands allow the user to configure their GeoIPS
      environment. This includes configuring GeoIPS' behavior (NOT IMPLEMENTED),
      managing it's plugin registries, and installing static datasets required for
      certain algorithms and for integration tests.
    usage_str: |
      To use, type `geoips config <cmd> <sub-command> ...`
    output_info:
      - Output related to config process that was run.
  geoips_config_install:
    help_str: "Install static datasets for use certain algorithms or integration tests."
    description: |
      The `geoips config install` command installs static datasets required by GeoIPS.
      Some of these datasets are required for certain algorithms (e.g. LUTs for Rayleigh
      scattering correction). Others are test datasets for use with GeoIPS' integration
      tests.

      A list of available datasets can be obtained by running `geoips list
      test-datasets`.

      Data will be downloaded to `$GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR` by default. This can be
      overridden by providing a path via the `-o/--outdir` option.

      To install all available datasets, use `geoips config install all`. Note that this
      will require more than 100GB of space.

      Create plugin registries for plugin packages found in the specified namespace.

      This should not be required unless the user has disabled automatic registry
      generation.

      When called, by default, `geoips config create-registries` will find all plugin
      packages installed in the `geoips` namespace and generate a plugin registry in
      json format for each. If a different namespace is desired, `-n/--namespace` may be
      provided to specify that namespace. A subset of the available packages can be
      operated on by providing `-p/--packages`. The format can be specified by passing
      `-s/--save_type`.

      packages installed in the `geoips` namespace any plugin registries that it finds.

  geoips_describe: &geoips-describe-artifact
    help_str: "Print detailed information about a GeoIPS artifact."
    description: |
      The `geoips describe` command prints detailed information about a specific GeoIPS
      artifact where an artifact can be a registered plugin package, a plugin interface,
      or a plugin.

<<<<<<< HEAD
      To get information on different types of artifacts, use the command forms below:
        - Plugin Packages: `geoips describe package <package_name>`
          For example, `geoips describe package geoips_clavrx` would return information
          on the `geoips_clavrx` package.
        - Interfaces: `geoips describe <interface_name>`
          For example, `geoips describe readers` would return information regarding the
          readers interface.
        - Plugins: `geoips describe <interface_name> <plugin_name>`
          For example, `geoips describe reader abi_netcdf` would retrun information
          regarding the `abi_netcdf` reader plugin.

  geoips_tree:
    help_str: |
      Print a tree of all of the available GeoIPS CLI commands. This will display every
      command in a top-down tree which gives a visual structure of how the CLI can be
      ran. <--max-depth> must be greater than or equal to 0, where depth denotes the
      level of the command you'd like to display. Ie. <0> geoips <1> list <2> scripts.
    usage_str: |
      To use, type `geoips tree <--max-depth> <int> <--color> <--short-name>`.
    output_info:
      - The tree of available GeoIPS CLI commands up to '--max-depth' levels, where
        depth denotes the level of the command you'd like to display.
        I.e. <0> geoips <1> list <2> scripts.
        Can be colored output if wanted and can define whether or not we want the full
        command string or just the name of the command at the specified depth.
  geoips_validate:
    help_str: |
      Validate a GeoIPS Plugin found at <file_path>. While this is done under the hood
      via GeoIPS, this is an easy way to test whether or not the plugin you are
      developing is valid. If the <file_path> you're trying to validate is a
      multi-document YAML file, you'll also need to provide the name of the plugin
      within that file for this command to work.
    usage_str: |
      To use, type `geoips validate <file_path> OPT_ARG <plugin_name>`.
    output_info:
      - A message telling you if the plugin is valid or not and why.

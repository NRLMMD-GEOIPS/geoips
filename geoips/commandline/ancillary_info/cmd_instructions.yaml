instructions:
  geoips_config:
    help_str: |
      Various configuration-based commands for setting up your geoips environment.
      Currently supports `geoips config install ...` and
      `geoips config <create/delete-registries>` commands.
    usage_str: |
      To use, type `geoips config <cmd> <sub-command> ...`
    output_info:
      - Output related to config process that was run.
  geoips_config_install:
    help_str: |
      Install appropriate test dataset(s) based on the arguments provided. To see a list
      of available test datasets for install, run `geoips list test-datasets`. If
      wanting to install data to a location different that $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR, then
      use the -o (outdir) option and provide a full path to the directory you desire to
      install data in.

      Optionally, you can run the command 'geoips config install all', which will
      install all test datasets listed in 'geoips list test-datasets'. If 'all' is
      provided, no other dataset can be specified.
    usage_str: |
      To use, type `geoips config install <test_dataset_names> -o <full_path>`.
    output_info:
      - Not Applicable
  geoips_config_create-registries:
    help_str: |
      Create plugin registries for one or more plugin packages of a certain namespace.
      By default, this command uses namespace 'geoips.plugin_packages', but this can
      be overridden with the -n (--namespace) flag. If you want to create plugin
      registries for a subset of packages of the specified namespace, you can provide
      the -p (--packages) flag, which should be a list of one or more package names
      to create plugin registries for that fall under 'namespace'. Additionally, you
      can add the -s (--save_type) flag, which is a string that can be either 'json' or
      'yaml', specifying the file format of your registry. By default, GeoIPS expects
      'json' as the file format to use, and that is the default of this flag.
    usage_str: |
      To use, type `geoips config create-registries -n <namespace> -s <save_type>
      -p <packages>`.
    output_info:
      - Not Applicable
  geoips_config_delete-registries:
    help_str: |
      Delete plugin registries in one or more plugin packages of a certain namespace.
      By default, this command uses namespace 'geoips.plugin_packages', but this can
      be overridden with the -n (--namespace) flag. If you want to delete plugin
      registries for a subset of packages of the specified namespace, you can provide
      the -p (--packages) flag, which should be a list of one or more package names
      to create plugin registries for that fall under 'namespace'.
      Install the appropriate test dataset and/or package based on the arguments
      provided. To see a list of available test datasets for install, run
      `geoips list test-datasets`.

    usage_str: |

  #     expects that the unit tests implemented are pytest-based. Defaults to the
  #     'geoips' package.
  #   usage_str: |
  #     To use, type

  geoips_tree:
    help_str: |
      Print a tree of all of the available GeoIPS CLI commands. This will display every
      command in a top-down tree which gives a visual structure of how the CLI can be
      ran. <--max-depth> must be greater than or equal to 0, where depth denotes the
      level of the command you'd like to display. Ie. <0> geoips <1> list <2> scripts.
    usage_str: |
      To use, type `geoips tree <--max-depth> <int> <--color> <--short-name>`.
    output_info:
      - The tree of available GeoIPS CLI commands up to '--max-depth' levels, where
        depth denotes the level of the command you'd like to display.
        I.e. <0> geoips <1> list <2> scripts.
        Can be colored output if wanted and can define whether or not we want the full
        command string or just the name of the command at the specified depth.
  geoips_validate:
    help_str: |
      Validate a GeoIPS Plugin found at <file_path>. While this is done under the hood
      via GeoIPS, this is an easy way to test whether or not the plugin you are
      developing is valid. If the <file_path> you're trying to validate is a
      multi-document YAML file, you'll also need to provide the name of the plugin
      within that file for this command to work.
    usage_str: |
      To use, type `geoips validate <file_path> OPT_ARG <plugin_name>`.
    output_info:
      - A message telling you if the plugin is valid or not and why.

    """

    def __call__(self, level_name, level_num):
        """Comprehensively adds a new logging level to the `logging` module.

        Comprehensively adds a new logging level named `level_name` to the `logging`
        module and the currently configured logging class. The new logging level's
        precidence is set by `level_num`. For example, a level_num of `15` would create
        a logging level that falls between `logging.DEBUG` and `logging.INFO` whose
        level_num are `10` and `20`, respectively.

        Calling this function will add the following to the logging class:
        - A new log level named `logging.{level_name}`
        - A new logging function called `logging.{level_name.lower()]}`

        To avoid conflicts between the log level attribute and the logging function,
        `level_name` must not be entirely lowercase.

        Parameters
        ----------
        level_name : str
            Name for the new log level. This must not be completely lowercase.
        level_num : int
            Numeric precidence of the new log level.

        `level_name` becomes an attribute of the `logging` module with the value
        `level_num`. `methodName` becomes a convenience method for both `logging`
        itself and the class returned by `logging.getLoggerClass()` (usually just
        `logging.Logger`). If `methodName` is not specified, `level_name.lower()` is
        used.

        To avoid accidental clobberings of existing attributes, this method will
        raise an `AttributeError` if the level name is already an attribute of the
        `logging` module or if the method name is already present

        -------

        >>> logging.getLogger(__name__).setLevel("TRACE")
        >>> logging.getLogger(__name__).trace('that worked')

def setup_logging(logging_level=None, verbose=True):
    """Get a new logger instance for GeoIPS.

    Get a new logger instance for GeoIPS. This will set the logger's logging level, its
    formatter, and add a `StreamHandler` pointing to `sys.stdout`.

    This is most often used at the top-level of an applcation to set up the root logger
    for the application (e.g. in a command line script). Once configured, the root
    logger's properties will be inherited by lower-level logger instances. So, to use
    the same logging configuration in submodules, simply instantiate a new logger
    instance via `LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)` and it will behave the same as the
    root logger.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logging_level : str, default=None
        Sets the minimum log level for which log output will be written to stdout.
        If None, will default to "INTERACTIVE".  This allows using env var
        GEOIPS_LOGGING_LEVEL to override default (applied in run_procflow).
    verbose : bool, default=True
        Determines which log formatter will be used. If `True`, a longer format will be
        used, providing more information, but also cluttering the screen. If `False`, a
        shorter format will be used.

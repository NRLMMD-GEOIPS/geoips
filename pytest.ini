    # Optional and tiny_sector or sample_output typically marked concurrently.
    # This provides an exhaustive test of all tiny sectors and example imagery tests.

    optional: OPTIONAL INDEPENDENT - marks tests as optional (select with '-m "optional"', exclude with '-m "not optional"')
    disabled: OPTIONAL INDEPENDENT - marks tests as disabled (select with '-m "disabled"', exclude with '-m "not disabled"')
    sample_output: CONCURRENT - marks optional integration tests as producing example imagery outputs (no image output comparisons)
    tiny_sector: CONCURRENT - marks optional integration tests as specifically testing ALL tiny_sectors (select with '-m "tiny_sector"')

    # integration and spans_multiple_packages
    # can be applied concurrently with other markers.

    scheduler: CONCURRENT - marks tests as part of a suite of schedulers, for use in realtime processing (select with '-m "scheduler"')
    system: CONCURRENT - marks tests as part of a system-wide test (select with '-m "system"')
    integration: CONCURRENT - marks tests as integration (select with '-m "integration"')
    spans_multiple_packages: CONCURRENT - marks integration tests that test functionality that could fail due to errors in multiple repositories. e.g. listing or validating all plugins, etc. Allows calling tests to ensure the same error will not cause tests in multiple repos to fail.

    # base+full is a complete test of everything within the current repository
    # If any tests require functionality in another plugin repository (besides the
    # geoips repository), they should additionally be marked with
    # "spans_multiple_packages"

    # These markers should be disjoint - there should be
    # NO common tests between them. Always include a single base test for basic
    # functionality tests for the plugin repo.

    base: REQUIRED INDEPENDENT - integration tests that complete very quickly and require only a minimal installation for testing basic functionality within the current repository
    full: REQUIRED INDEPENDENT - integration tests that require a 'full' installation for testing all functionality within the current repository. 'full' marker includes all tests for the current repo except for tests included in the optional 'base' marker.

    # provides a complete test of a full GeoIPS System-wide implementation.
    # These tests are not required for implementing functionality
    # within GeoIPS, only for testing a complete local system install for real-time
    # processing. The majority of GeoIPS developers will not use these markers.
    # Please see software requirements specification (SRS) for more information on the
    # "GeoIPS System" definition.

    # These markers should be disjoint - there should be
    # NO common tests between them.

    external_preprocessing: INDEPENDENT GeoIPS System Implementation - integration tests that test external preprocessing functionality that is not part of geoips core (e.g., CLAVR-x build and pre-processing, CSPP build and pre-processing, etc)
    realtime: INDEPENDENT GeoIPS System Implementation - integration tests that test full real-time functionality, using a fully defined set of procflow configs testing every installed plugin package.
    driver: INDEPENDENT GeoIPS System Implementation - integration tests that test drivers for real-time processing capabilities
    scrubber: INDEPENDENT GeoIPS System Implementation - integration tests that test data scrubbing functionality
    database: INDEPENDENT GeoIPS System Implementation - integration tests that test database capabilities
    downloader: INDEPENDENT GeoIPS System Implementation - integration tests that test data ingest capabilities

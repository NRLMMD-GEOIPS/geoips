GeoIPS Base Package
====================

The GeoIPS Base Package provides a Python 3 based architecture supporting a wide variety of
satellite and weather data processing. The modular nature of the GeoIPS base infrastructure also allows
plug-and-play capability for user-specified custom functionality.

Please see
[GeoIPS documentation](./docs/source/geoips_index.rst)
for more information on GeoIPS capabilities and use cases.

Installation
---------------------------------------
See the
[installation guide](./docs/source/installation.rst)
within the source code documentation for installation instructions. GeoIPS has a fully supported
exhaustive installation process, including a full conda environment, as well as a more basic
pip based installation for "expert" users.

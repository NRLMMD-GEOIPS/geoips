# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo.

# All PRs to default branch require one NRL and one CIRA review
# CODEOWNERS file can only require a single team, so requiring NRL here,
# implying the other of the 2 required reviews should be from a CIRA member.

# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.

# More info:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @cira-review and @nrl-review will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

name: Build stable docker image

# 1. Tag and Release - on merge of v*-version-release
#    * Tag current version
#    * Release just tagged version
# 2. Package and Publish - on published release (from #1)
#    * Build wheel
#    * Publish to pypi
# 3. Deploy docs - on published release (from #1)
#    * pip install geoips
#    * pip install plugin repo
#    * build docs with geoips/docs/build_docs.sh
#    * deploy docs with geoips/docs/deploy_pages.sh
# 4. GEOIPS REPO ONLY - build stable docker image on published release (from #1)
#    * Stable image required for all plugin packages to use for CI
#    * doc-test workflow will fail on all plugin packages without stable image.
#    * reusable-build-docker-image is set up to build specifically the stable
#      image on the default branch - since this workflow is run after merge to
#      the default branch, it will build the stable image.

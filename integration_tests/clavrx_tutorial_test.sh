# This should contain test calls to cover ALL required functionality tests for the @package@ repo.

# The $GEOIPS tests modules sourced within this script handle:
   # setting up the appropriate associative arrays for tracking the overall return value,
   # calling the test scripts appropriately, and 
   # setting the final return value.

# Note you must use the variable "call" in the for the loop

# Argument to test_all_pre.sh ONLY sets the prefix on the log output / filenames.
# Used for clarity, and to differentiate potentially multiple "test_all.sh" scripts in the same repo.
